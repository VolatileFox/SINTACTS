+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 12:59 PM",Yes,"I didn't ask because you seem like someone who is careful about privacy. Also this is Andrew, also this is the second time sending this message. I thoroughly confused a stranger just moments ago. 7887 not 7877"
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 12:59 PM",No,Bwahahahaha 
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 12:59 PM",No,"Yeah, well, I offered so it's okay that you have my number now. "
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 1:22 PM",No,"Hey, how about the Palladium at 9? Or did you guys really want to do the Silverado?"
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 1:24 PM",Yes,I don't mind when or where. I can pass that on. I'm still waiting for a response from Kelli/Reggie. They're both at work lol so I have to wait for them to by on break.
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 1:25 PM",No,Okay. I was just thinking if we did the Palladium then we could eat somewhere around there too. 
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 5:08 PM",Yes,BJs Restaurant at 8? Is that cool? Kelli suggested it.
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 5:09 PM",No,Sounds perfect. 
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 5:11 PM",Yes,745 actually. 8 might be cutting it close unless we inhale the food.
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 5:11 PM",No,Haha either way is fine. 
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 7:10 PM",Yes,Ok these people -_- lol. Do you like Chik fil a?

+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 8:23 PM",Yes,I'm still waiting on Reggie. Did you find Kelli?
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 8:29 PM",No,Is it okay if I just meet you guys at the theater?
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Sure
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 8:29 PM",No,I'm not at chik fil a. 
+12103557887,"Apr 17, 2014 8:30 PM",No,Sorry. I got caught up with family stuff. But I'll still be there. 
+17069923021,"Apr 17, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,It's ok. See you there.
+17069923021,"Apr 18, 2014 8:38 PM",Yes,Hey last night was really fun. Totally should have gone to bed earlier though. I don't know how you've managed two 3-hour nights in a row.
+12103557887,"Apr 18, 2014 8:40 PM",No,"Last night was fun, yes. Very fun. I'm glad you invited me. And as far as sleep goes, maybe that's my superpower. Haha. But no, I am pretty tired. Next time we'll go to bed earlier haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 18, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,Are there any cult classic movies you haven't seen? Would you want to have a movie marathon sometime?
+12103557887,"Apr 18, 2014 8:53 PM",No,A movie marathon would be awesome! I'm sure there are many many movies I haven't seen haha  if you made a list I could say if I have or not.

+17069923021,"Apr 18, 2014 8:55 PM",Yes,Haha I thought we were gonna have people to play last night! Everyone bailed! 
+12103557887,"Apr 18, 2014 8:57 PM",No,It was still fun though. And maybe a board game night would be good if it started earlier and dinner came along with the games. We can try that another time. 
+17069923021,"Apr 19, 2014 4:08 PM",Yes,I like how last night we kind of inadvertently sent Kelli and Rick on a dinner date at Chik Fil A lol. 
+12103557887,"Apr 19, 2014 4:09 PM",No,Hahahaha yeah we did 
+12103557887,"Apr 19, 2014 4:09 PM",No,I didn't even realize that haha

+12103557887,"Apr 19, 2014 7:33 PM",No,"I mean, after church and everything."

+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 12:51 AM",No,Do you want me to just get a handful together and you all can pick from that?
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:54 AM",Yes,Bring stuff you don't mind watching again.
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 12:55 AM",No,Haha that's everything I own! I don't buy it unless I've seen it and would watch it again. I'm a snob that way lol
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:55 AM",Yes,So you don't get board =P
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 12:55 AM",No,I won't be bored lol
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:56 AM",Yes,Haha each movie I own has a time cycle associated with it. I can't rewatch it until a certain amount of time has passed haha.
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 12:56 AM",No,"I'm like that with some movies, but not many haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:57 AM",Yes,"Some movies have shorter cycles than others. Like Inception is a year, and Jurassic Park is like 3 hours."
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 12:58 AM",No,Hahahaha did you watch it again on Friday after I left? Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:59 AM",Yes,I was tempted. Haha ok maybe not really 3 hours. But I have prolly seen that movie at least a few hundred times in my life.
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 12:59 AM",Yes,Just like Airplane. When I was in highschool I would watch that movie every single night when I went to bed.
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 1:00 AM",No,That's a lot of viewings lol 
+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 1:00 AM",No,I don't think I have a movie like that. But I do have lots that I've seen several dozen times.

+12103557887,"Apr 20, 2014 2:50 PM",No,Is it okay for me to head your way? Just finished lunch with my Dad. 
+17069923021,"Apr 20, 2014 2:51 PM",Yes,"Yeah, I'm starting cream puffs! lol "

+12103557887,"Apr 21, 2014 1:34 AM",No,No. I just got home
+17069923021,"Apr 21, 2014 1:35 AM",Yes,Ok. Just making sure. Otherwise I would have had to scold you.
+17069923021,"Apr 21, 2014 1:36 AM",Yes,Now get some sleep lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 21, 2014 1:36 AM",No,Haha no scolding necessary. And I will. I'm already about to fall into bed.

+12103557887,"Apr 21, 2014 1:16 PM",No,Thanks for sharing it with me. My life is slightly more complete hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,I don't think I even laughed that hard when I saw it the first time lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,I got the closing team to do a 1 2 3 Hail Hydra!
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:50 PM",No,Well I certainly laughed pretty hard. What made it funnier this time? 
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:51 PM",No,And that's awesome by the way. Hail Hydra!
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 7:52 PM",Yes,It was funnier because you were laughing a much. I didn't think you were going to like it lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:53 PM",No,Well I loved it! It deserves many more viewings for sure. I love to laugh. Why didn't you think I'd like it? Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 7:54 PM",Yes,Idk I'm not 100% on your movie preferences yet.
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:53 PM",No,I don't know that I am either haha 
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:55 PM",No,I like a wide variety of stuff.

+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 7:55 PM",No,They were also very good. 
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:00 PM",Yes,=D thanks. I do cookies too. But those require a lot of focus lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:01 PM",No,You've mentioned that haha. I do pies and truffles lol
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:01 PM",No,And crumbles and mousses too. I almost forgot.

+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:02 PM",No,Why? 
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,I have trouble eating fruit. Super intense gag reflex.
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,Especially when it's been cooked so it's soft
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:03 PM",No,I meant pumpkin pie. Lol. Do you eat that?
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:05 PM",Yes,I don't know if I've ever tried it. Ive basically just tried to stay away from pies my whole life because I just assume they'll make me gag. Except chocolate ones.
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:08 PM",No,"Haha well I never ate a pumpkin pie until four years after I had started baking the recipe I make. And it's the only pumpkin pie I'll eat. It's not chunky, almost more like cheesecake or an icebox pie. "
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:11 PM",No,"But I don't like cheesecake, so I'm just going off what people tell me haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:12 PM",No,I prefer cakes anyway.

+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:16 PM",No,What's your favorite cake flavor?
+17069923021,"Apr 22, 2014 8:18 PM",Yes,I think just chocolate. I'm not a fan of dark chocolate though.
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Best answer possible! Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 22, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Only chocolate for me too lol
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:48 PM",Yes,"Would you be interested in joining me on a ""explore a new church"" adventure sometime?"

+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:46 PM",No,Yes and yes
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:46 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:46 PM",No,You make me smile. It's nice. 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:46 PM",No,😁
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,Haha. I keep trying to convince myself to get up and go somewhere but it's nerve racking when you're alone. =\
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,And ice cream is super hard to eat.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,It's painful lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:51 PM",No,"Yeah, trying new churches is hard for me too. Did you have one in mind? I was thinking of trying Bandera Road Christian Church. "
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:51 PM",No,Hahaha why is it painful? And what about frozen yogurt?
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:53 PM",Yes,I don't really have any in mind. Usually when I can talk myself into going I just find a random one nearby and go. Not a very well thought out approach haha.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:54 PM",No,Haha maybe that's why it hasn't been successful 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:54 PM",Yes,"And as for ice cream, i think my mouth is just super sensitive to temperatures."
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:54 PM",No,Mine is too. Haha so I have to eat it slowly. 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 7:55 PM",No,How was your day?
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,I did some sales planners for the first time ever. That was fun. I just right this second picked up a spider that was descending from the ceiling right in front of me. What about you? Anything eventful?
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,"Lunch of over, if I don't reply that's why."
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 8:01 PM",No,"Yeah I liked doing sales planners but it was hard for me to feel productive with them because I always kept getting pulled away from them every five seconds, so it took forever. \LFNot much happened at work. I decorated the break room for a special lunch we had today haha. And I bought tickets to a concert in Austin that my sister and I are going to. So that's cool. Haha okay, well have a good night at work then. Text me when you can. "
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,What's the concert?
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 10:50 PM",No,Birdy and Christina Perri
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 10:50 PM",No,I'm wanting to see Birdy mostly. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,I've never heard of Birdy. I do know who Christina Perri is though.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 10:52 PM",No,She's a really young singer/songwriter from Britain who plays the piano. Very indie. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 10:56 PM",Yes,They've got some really cool outfits in her wings video
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 10:57 PM",No,You looked her up? Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 10:57 PM",No,"Find her version of ""Skinny Love"" if you can. It's really pretty. "
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,wow.. That was kinda sad.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:04 PM",No,Hahaha it's been a rough year for me lol
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:06 PM",No,I mostly like what she does with her voice. The tone is really pretty. I try to ignore the words and just listen to the melody I guess  
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,She does have quite a voice.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:07 PM",No,Yeah. She's only like 15 or so. 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:07 PM",No,That's amazing to me. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:08 PM",Yes,Waht??
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:07 PM",No,Superhuman
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:09 PM",No,"Okay, no, she's 17 now. But she released her first album at 15. Started recording it at 14. "
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:10 PM",Yes,She's still young. I always wondered high school aged people manage an entertainment career at scuba young age.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:11 PM",Yes,*such haha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Yes scuba is hard at a young age lol
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:11 PM",Yes,Scuuuuuuba
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Yeah I know what you mean. 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:13 PM",No,"It's crazy to see how early some people get started in their careers. But, maybe that's partly why they are so successful, because of the shock factor and what-not. "
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:13 PM",No,"Who knows... Either way, I really like her voice. "
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:13 PM",No,And it should be fun. I haven't been to a concert in I don't know how long. 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:13 PM",No,Years. Many many years. Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,I don't know if I've ever even been to a real concert lol. I was supposed to go see Owl City in DC a couple years ago but the person in charge of getting the tickets waited too long and it sold out. But she didn't tell me this till after I had gotten my ticket to fly to DC. Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Oh man. Did you at least enjoy DC? The Smithsonian is pretty awesome!
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,"On top of that once that weekend rolled around, most of us were sick and we spent the weekend doing things sick people shouldn't do like hiking and sledding down snowless hills."
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:20 PM",No,That sounds fun!
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:21 PM",Yes,We spent no time in DC haha. We were so sick. I had developed a horrible sinus infection by the time I had to fly back. It was a very interesting weekend.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:22 PM",Yes,And feverish and such. There was a lot of delirious wanderings.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:22 PM",No,"I used to do silly stuff like play in the snow in my bathing suit, so I understand the delirious wanderings lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,What? Why? Weren't you cold? Did you get sick all the time?
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Haha because it was fun lol 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,Touché
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:25 PM",Yes,And this was at what age? Lol
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:24 PM",No,"It was cold but you got used to it. And no, I never got sick from that lol"
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:24 PM",No,8-14. When I lived in places that snowed lol
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:26 PM",Yes,I was always very careful as a child but I would get sick every few months and it would last forever! That is until I got those thingies in my mouth removed. Then I stopped getting sick so often.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:27 PM",No,Yeah I got strep every year at least twice. But I guess I was a little more carefree in those days lol
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:28 PM",No,"Hey, when are you going to Seattle again? "
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,Uh..
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,One sec
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,The 16th is when I end up in Seattle
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:29 PM",No,Haha okay
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:29 PM",No,My plans changed. I'm there from the 12th-18th. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Are you serious???
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Overlap!!
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Haha yeah. I'm serious. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:31 PM",Yes,Are you going to be free at all though?
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:32 PM",No,"Yes. I'm going without my friend now. So I get to explore and see family on my own. My sister might go with me, but that's not final yet. And I already bought the ticket, so either way I'm going. Haha"
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:33 PM",No,"So, yeah, I'll be free. "
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,We'll have to meet up!
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:33 PM",No,Yeah?
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:34 PM",No,That would be fun!
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:36 PM",Yes,Are you going to actually be IN Seattle? Or an outlying city?
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:37 PM",No,In the city. I'll be staying with my Aunt. She lives downtown. But everything is pretty close up there. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes,"I'm going to be in DuPont, but I'm planning on making trips to Seattle to see stuff."
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:41 PM",No,"Well, if you need someone to do stuff with just let me know haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,I definitely will.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,So I got an odd compliment today.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:42 PM",No,Which was?
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,"I was at a register and this man told me I had impeccable enunciation. Haha. Then he said, ""You're not from around here are you?"""
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Hahaha that's awesome 
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"And you said ""no, no I'm not"" lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:45 PM",Yes,I believe those were my exact words lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"Taking extra care to pronounce the ""t"" and the end of ""not"""
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:45 PM",No,*at the end
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:46 PM",Yes,The after I told him my life story we started talking about the houses and beaches in Florida.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:47 PM",No,Was he from Florida as well?
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:48 PM",Yes,He said he took a trip to St Pete recently
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:48 PM",No,That's cool. I've never been to Florida. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,It is pretty gorgeous there. But the humidity makes you want to slam your face into a brick wall.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:50 PM",No,What?! Bwahahahahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,Ok maybe now that bad.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:52 PM",Yes,*not
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:52 PM",No,That's pretty bad lol
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,I don't miss Florida very much. But I do miss the thunderstorms. So so much. Such beautiful monstrosities.
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:54 PM",Yes,Last time I experienced anything close to a Florida storm was when I lived in Italy. And those still weren't as intense.
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:54 PM",No,Yeah storms were fun growing up. I miss the clean smell of rain. It smells like cat pee when it rains here haha. We had lots of hurricane type winds with our storms in Washington. So that was crazy. 
+17069923021,"Apr 23, 2014 11:57 PM",Yes,We don't get enough thunder here. It's so sappy! I need my thunder to knock dishes out of my cabinets!
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:58 PM",No,"The house rattling kind? Yeah, that's not here at all. "
+12103557887,"Apr 23, 2014 11:59 PM",No,Even the rain is wimpy. It's depressing. I miss having four actual seasons. And snow. I really miss snow. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,Do you want to move back to Washington someday?
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:02 AM",No,I'd love to move back to the Northwest. I certainly don't want to stay here much longer. Just depends on what God's got in store for me. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,I'd like to live somewhere Northern eventually. I'm not big on the hot and sunny scene.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:06 AM",No,"Yeah me neither. I like sun, but I like being able to sit in the shade and have it cooler than sitting in the sun lol. "
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:07 AM",No,And these 100+ degree summers have been killing me slowly for years. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:09 AM",No,Where would you want to move?
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,I honestly don't know. I don't really feel like I have a home anywhere. I just want to be around people I care about.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:15 AM",No,"That makes sense. I feel like the Northwest is my home, but my family is mostly down here so moving immediately would be difficult. "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,I've often thought about just picking a random place and going.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:15 AM",No,But it seems like they're all eventually migrating up to that corner of the U.S.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:15 AM",No,Like getting a map and pointing? Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:17 AM",No,That could be a valid way to pick a place to live I guess haha
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:23 AM",Yes,"Haha. Almost my entire family is in Florida. But my brother and I are not too fond of it. I think both of us have some ""emotional scarring""? that happened around the time my parents and I left to move to GA. And over the years developed a lot of negative energy towards Florida. Am I getting to psychological now? lol"
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:24 AM",No,Haha no. I feel the same about Texas lol. Where does your brother love?
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:24 AM",No,Hahaha whoops *live
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,He loves in Portland.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,He also lives there.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:24 AM",No,Bwahahahaha. That's cool. Portland is awesome. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:26 AM",No,I miss those streets haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:26 AM",No,And the food. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:29 AM",Yes,My brother is a cook... I miss having him here. For food AND 'cause I love him lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:29 AM",Yes,He did live with us in San Antonio for about a year. He moved here after lost his job.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:29 AM",No,And suddenly the creme puffs make so much more sense haha. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:30 AM",No,"Ad he lived here for one year, hated it, and moved on as quickly as possible? Haha"
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:31 AM",No,*and
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:32 AM",Yes,Basically. He had just gotten married. And when he lost his job they moved down here because they had no monies. Omg you would have loved my sister in law. When her and I were together the puns would not stop!
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:33 AM",No,Hahaha puns are fun!
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:34 AM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:34 AM",No,Hopefully you can zoom in lol
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:36 AM",Yes,Haha I've seen that page before.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:36 AM",No,Yeah I've had it saved for a while lol. Too bad it wasn't anything new 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:37 AM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:37 AM",Yes,Haha this was when I copied your number wrong.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:38 AM",No,Hahaha that's funny
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:38 AM",No,There wasn't any additional response? 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:39 AM",Yes,No =( I was so hoping for one too.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:39 AM",No,Yeah that would've been awesome. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:39 AM",No,"Honestly though, I feel like I've met the person with that phone number lol"
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:39 AM",No,I think they worked with me at Hollister. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 AM",No,But I could be wrong. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 AM",Yes,Haha should I ask them if they ever worked at Hollister?
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 AM",No,"I remember being like ""what? That's almost my number!"" "
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:41 AM",No,"Hmmm, if they never responded again then they were probably annoyed. And if it's the person I think it was, then her boyfriend probably wouldn't enjoy the weird messages. "
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:43 AM",No,It was either a Lauren or an Elena. And they were both not very nice girls. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:43 AM",Yes,Haha.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:45 AM",Yes,"My cell number has a Columbus, GA area code. Let me tell you. I have gotten some weird wrong number calls and texts."
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:46 AM",Yes,The texts are fun though because I can play along.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:47 AM",No,"I have a tendency to not answer calls if I don't recognize the number, unless I'm expecting a call. And I've never gotten a weird text before. "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:50 AM",Yes,Oh yeah I never answer calls unless I know who is calling. People leave messages on my voicemail though. Even after listening to my message. Haha.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:49 AM",No,Really? No one ever leaves me messages by mistake haha
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:53 AM",Yes,I'm trying to figure out how to say this without sounding like a horrible person.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:53 AM",Yes,It's not a very educated local.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:54 AM",Yes,Locale
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:54 AM",No,Georgia?
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:54 AM",Yes,Columbus GA
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:54 AM",No,"Gotcha haha I thought you were planning on insulting me lol since you weren't sure how to ""say something without sounding like a horrible person"" "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:56 AM",Yes,Oh no! 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:56 AM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:56 AM",No,"I was thinking ""what must he think of me"" lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:59 AM",Yes,Maybe I should just jump right into what I'm about to say and apologize later. Whenever I preface something I tend to give the wrong idea lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:59 AM",No,That wouldn't have even needed an apology lol
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:00 AM",No,You're too nice. Much nicer than most. But that's a good thing. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:00 AM",Yes,Thank you.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:01 AM",No,Of course. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:05 AM",Yes,You know you can tell me if and whenever you want to go to sleep right? I really don't want to infringe on your sleep.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:06 AM",No,Haha yeah I know. You can do the same though. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:06 AM",No,"Rather than though, I should have said too "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:09 AM",Yes,Hey I do though. lol
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:11 AM",Yes,I do need to work on some homework though. And you should get some rest. You wake up earlier than I do.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:11 AM",No,Yeah I probably do haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:11 AM",No,"Well, good luck with the homework then and sorry to keep you from school. "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:13 AM",Yes,It's been fun procrastinating with you haha. Goodnight.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:13 AM",No,Haha yeah it was worth missing out on some sleep lol. Night 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:28 PM",Yes,That person worked at Hollister. O_O
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:29 PM",No,You asked? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:29 PM",Yes,You got me wondering. lol
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:30 PM",No,Did it leave off there? Or are you still asking questions? Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:31 PM",Yes,I just left it there. Wasn't really sure what else to say after that. Should I? Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:32 PM",No,No haha leave it there. They all gossip a whole lot and if my name was brought up it could turn into stupidness. Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:35 PM",Yes,I would never drop your name. I respect your anonymity.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:37 PM",Yes,=P
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:37 PM",No,Hahaha well thanks for that. It's up to you if you want to ask. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:37 PM",No,"And yeah, I tend to stay pretty private. "
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:38 PM",No,"But who knows, maybe you'll gain a new friend. "
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 PM",Yes,I think I'll hold off lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 PM",No,Hahahaha okay 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 PM",No,How was class?
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:40 PM",No,Or are you off today?
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:46 PM",Yes,I spent the whole class on imgur. I really only went in to turn in my homework and pickup my exam. And I learned that my professor knows me by name. I asked him about the exams and he walked over to his pile and pulled mine out. I don't recall ever telling him my name. I don't even show up to half his classes. O_O 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:48 PM",No,"Haha I had a professor like that once too. I always read novels for my other classes during his lectures and one day he decided to call on me to answer a question. Fortunately, I can double task reasonably well so I had at least been following along. He thought he got me though, so he was disappointed when I argued a different point on the topic. Haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:49 PM",Yes,Nice save.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:50 PM",Yes,I guess maybe they read our jakes everytime we turn something in.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:50 PM",No,Yeah I can be pretty smooth every once in a blue moon. Haha but usually I'm pretty awkward 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:50 PM",No,Yeah that would make sense. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:58 PM",Yes,Awkward is good too though.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:58 PM",Yes,It makes for interesting stories.
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 12:59 PM",Yes,So how's work?
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 12:59 PM",No,And I have many of those interesting stories hahaha unfortunately. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:01 PM",No,"Work is okay. I'm having to diffuse a couple of arguments between full grown adults this week. It's all really petty and shouldn't even be an issue, but since it's my job to manage them I have to is a way to get these groups of adults to treat eachother like adults and not children. "
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:01 PM",No,*find a way
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:03 PM",Yes,Barney songs...
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:04 PM",Yes,That sounds tough. Crowd controlling a dispute is not fun.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:04 PM",No,Yeah.... I guess. But I don't play the guitar so it couldn't be a real Kumbaya Fest either haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:05 PM",No,"I'm decent at crowd controlling, but it still gives me a headache. I don't know why people can't be nice to eachother and forgive others for their mistakes. So much in this world would be easier if we let go of our egos. "

+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:33 PM",No,Yes that would be advisable. 
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 1:33 PM",No,I just ate. Turkey sandwich. It was alright. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 1:37 PM",Yes,I just remembered I had that leftover stir fry. I wonder if it's any good. Oh well I'm about to find out.

+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 4:04 PM",No,Yes haha
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 4:16 PM",Yes,I think I'm gonna get it. I don't have any of these yet.

+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 5:09 PM",Yes,"Doh I should have looked. Well at least I have 3 new movies to add to my server =D. It was everyone at the boat giving comments on the movies. Darrian, Reggie, and Stefon. I came into work to finish up some training paperwork."
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 5:10 PM",No,Ah I see. What are you doing training paperwork for?
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 5:11 PM",Yes,And you are one of I believe just two people I've showed Ishtar to.
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 5:11 PM",No,Well I'm honored then haha. And thanks for sharing it with me. 
+17069923021,"Apr 24, 2014 5:12 PM",Yes,They're making me complete learning plans for all my trainees now. It's weird. I've never had to do that before.

+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 8:29 PM",No,The best time I've ever had was when I kidnapped my best friend in high school and took her to the zoo. She was blindfolded and had ear plugs in. It was epic. We took her all the way to the butterfly house where she felt them getting on her arms and started freaking out before we took off the blindfold. But I won't blindfold you. I won't be that weird haha
+12103557887,"Apr 24, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Unless you don't want it to be a surprise.

+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 5:38 PM",No,Cologne? Hahaha that's an interesting choice of solvents. Maybe that's what te gasoline should have been used for...nail polish remover. You never painted my nails. Just remembered.

+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:18 PM",Yes,I know you mentioned trying that church on Bandera. Did you want to try it tomorrow by chance?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:21 PM",No,Haha it was pretty funny. Yeah we can try it tomorrow. Let me see what times the services are at. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:27 PM",No,"There's 8:45, 10:00, or 11:30. The 10 would probably be best for me, but it's up to you. "
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:30 PM",Yes,We'll then 10 it is. But that means I'm going to sleep early tonight haha. I'm worried I'm gonna get sick from lack of sleep recently.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:32 PM",No,Yeah a retail schedule can do that to you lol
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:33 PM",No,"And if you're able to go to bed early, then you should probably do that. You were very delirious after 2:00 last night, and yet you still didn't give in to the pull of sleep until 4:00 lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:36 PM",Yes,I didn't want our discussion to end. And I wasn't that delirious haha. I was just seeing weird things. Happens all the time.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:37 PM",No,Haha fair enough. You did fall in and out of consciousness at least three times though lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:38 PM",Yes,Did I really?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:37 PM",No,Yes haha
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:39 PM",No,That's why I kept saying you should go lay down
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:39 PM",Yes,=D I was laying down.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:40 PM",No,I meant in your bed! Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,How did you know I was unconscious? Did I say anything? lol
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:42 PM",No,Nope. I would ask a question and you wouldn't answer lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:43 PM",Yes,Maybe I was thinking
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:44 PM",No,So I would sit up and start cleaning. 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:44 PM",Yes,Haha. I saw you get up and put glasses away.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:44 PM",No,No lol cause then you'd say something unrelated to my question a few minutes later. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:44 PM",No,So you weren't just thinking. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:44 PM",No,And I didn't just clean up the glasses. 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:46 PM",Yes,Aw you didn't have to do that. I would have gotten all those things. Thank you
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:46 PM",No,It's fine. I figured I'd just let you rest haha
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:47 PM",Yes,I thought at one point I heard my laundry room door open. Did you put something away in there?
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,Or maybe you moved it when you opened the dishwasher.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:48 PM",No,No I closed it so I could put the glasses in the dishwasher. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:48 PM",No,"Yes, exactly"
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:50 PM",Yes,Did you want your leftovers? I realized they were still in the fridge
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:51 PM",No,Oh yeah whoops I tend to forget about that stuff lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,I've found rice rarely does well leftover unless you eat it like the next day. And even them if iffy.
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:56 PM",Yes,Like that day I ate my left over stirfry. It was pretty bad.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:56 PM",No,Really? How did you heat it back up? Did you steam it?
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:57 PM",Yes,"In a way. I poured some water into a bowl and then dumped everything on top, covered it, and microwaved it."
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:58 PM",Yes,Is there a better way to do it?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,With a steamer on a stovetop. I don't even own a microwave lol
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,"It takes longer, but it tastes normal and not dry and metallic. "
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:59 PM",Yes,I swear you told me to nuke it lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 9:59 PM",Yes,I think I gave my steamer away.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:00 PM",No,I meant to kill the bacteria haha
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:00 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:00 PM",No,Microwaves kill the taste though
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,I feel weird putting a mean in my rice cooker though. I'm don't think I'm supposed to do that lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:03 PM",No,A mean? What's that? 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:03 PM",Yes,Lol a meal
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:04 PM",No,Ohhh haha yeah rice cookers aren't meant for that. You just need to get a little steamer basket that you put in any pot. Steam leftovers that way. 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,Do you like Pesto?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:05 PM",No,I've never had it.... Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,O_O
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:05 PM",No,Yeah....
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:07 PM",Yes,Were going to have to fix that. So what's your favourite pasta sauce?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:07 PM",No,I make a homemade spicy Alfredo that's really good. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:07 PM",No,So maybe that lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:10 PM",Yes,Maybe I'll make some for you sometime. It's so good. You have to get freshly made pesto though. Can't be bottled.
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:11 PM",Yes,It's like eating little noodle heavens.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:11 PM",No,Yeah my mom always made fresh pesto growing up but she did some crazy stuff with food that made me nervous to try new things lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:13 PM",Yes,So now I'm thinking you're kinda like me food wise. Do you like to stick close to things you're familiar with? Safe tasting foods?
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:14 PM",No,Not always. I dunno. Maybe. Haha. Yeah probably. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:14 PM",No,But I will try new things. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:14 PM",No,Usually. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:14 PM",No,"Especially if it's a new recipe I want to try, but then I guess I'm also in control of what's going into the dish I'm making. "
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:16 PM",Yes,Exactly
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:16 PM",Yes,I'm very cautious ordering something new at a restaurant.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:16 PM",No,Haha but I can cook. I always get stuck cooking for my entire family every time there's a get together. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:16 PM",No,Yeah? I'll order new stuff as long as it's got stuff I'm comfortable with in it. 
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:16 PM",No,So I guess that's technically not really new then lol
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:19 PM",Yes,Although last night I really dug into that gyudon bowl. There were several things in there that I was clueless about.
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:19 PM",Yes,Maybe I was feeling adventurous.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:18 PM",No,Haha maybe
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:18 PM",No,The sushi was definitely a no go though lol
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:18 PM",No,Should've gone with Thai... 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:20 PM",Yes,But the Japanese was amazing.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:20 PM",No,Haha okay okay
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,I'm really happy that you brought me there. It was fantastic.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:20 PM",No,Well good. I'm glad
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:22 PM",Yes,"I haven't had as much fun as I had last night in a while. Really, it was a blast."
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:22 PM",No,Yeah? 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:22 PM",Yes,Yup
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:23 PM",No,Well maybe the cancelled show wasn't such a bad thing after all
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:24 PM",Yes,Not a bad thing at all. It felt spontaneous and exciting.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:25 PM",No,Haha I tried. And it was spontaneous. That was very little planning right there. 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:28 PM",Yes,I'll have to try and come up with something similarly fun and adventurous now for next time.
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:32 PM",No,Haha I'm up for it. 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 10:36 PM",Yes,"Well I'm going to try to go to eep now. Goodnight Jessie, I'll see you in the morning."
+12103557887,"Apr 26, 2014 10:36 PM",No,Night! 
+17069923021,"Apr 26, 2014 11:01 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:11 AM",No,Leaving my house now. Be at yours in 20. Okay?
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:22 AM",Yes,Haha ok.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:22 AM",No,Did you just wake up?
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:23 AM",Yes,no I just assumed we were meeting there.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:23 AM",No,Oh. Whoops. 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:24 AM",Yes,No you're fine if you want to meet up here.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:24 AM",No,It's up to you. 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:28 AM",Yes,If your already on your way over. 
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:28 AM",No,Haha yeah I am lol
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:20 PM",No,You're getting sick? 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,=( I feel like a might be.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:22 PM",No,That's not good. 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:23 PM",Yes,well at least I'm pretty much done with school.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:22 PM",No,That's true. When you get sick does it last a long time?
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:24 PM",No,"And honestly, I've been super exhausted all weekend. I got home today and slept for three hours. That's not really normal for me. "
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:25 PM",Yes,I'm usually sick for at least a week.
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:26 PM",Yes,I did to. I usually don't sleep during the day because it puts me in a bad mood. But I passed out on my bed shortly after I came upstairs.
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:28 PM",Yes,You had better not get sick too. lol
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:29 PM",No,Yeah I've been taking really long naps for the last three days. Not a good sign. I didn't get much of anything done this weekend at all lol 
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:29 PM",No,And if I get sick it'll probably just be a sinus infection or something like that 
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:31 PM",No,I have had headache for four days now too. Probably a sign of things to come....
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:31 PM",No,*a headache
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:35 PM",Yes,I'm sorry. I know mostly likely contributed to that. We can't stay up so late talking.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:35 PM",No,No it wasn't you haha. It's probably allergy related. But maybe we shouldn't stay up so late talking for your own sake now that you're coming down with something. 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:41 PM",Yes,Agreed. Easier said than done though.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:42 PM",No,Haha why? 
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,You're fun to talk to lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 27, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,I get addicted.
+12103557887,"Apr 27, 2014 9:43 PM",No,Oh haha. You're fun to talk to as well. Which is why I don't mind missing out on the sleep either. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,I keep trying to change my vocabulary three keep up with inflation.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,Wow and I missed 2
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:09 AM",No,It's not an easy feat three accomplish. I think it might take three much work. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:09 AM",No,Probably easier three do when it's written for you to memorize. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:10 AM",No,Ugh! I missed that last three three!
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:10 AM",Yes,Writeleven!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:10 AM",No,Argh. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:10 AM",No,Not cool
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:11 AM",No,I'm clearly not able to hang with that lingo. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:14 AM",Yes,It's just too early. It's not even 12 yet.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:14 AM",Yes,Or 13
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:14 AM",No,We keep missing at least two in every sentence. Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:17 AM",No,Are you feeling any better threeday?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:27 AM",Yes,II am feeling quite 2-bits better threeday. I think all I needed was just a decent night of sleep. I got a solid 9 hours lol. I mean actually 9. Not 8 + 1 lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:27 AM",No,Hahaha well that's good. Maybe sleep really was all you needed. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:08 PM",Yes,Are you still feeling sluggish and hungry for naps?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:09 PM",Yes,Well I guess you never actually said sluggish.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:08 PM",No,"I felt sluggish though haha. And yeah, I'm a bit nappish still "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:13 PM",Yes,Do you know why that is? I know sometimes I get sleepy and I have no idea why other than I'm bored.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:13 PM",Yes,I mean in your case.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:14 PM",No,"I think it's because of how back and forth the weather is, that messes with my brain and often gives me headaches and allergy type symptoms. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:18 PM",Yes,Ahh. Are you typically sensitive to allergens?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:20 PM",No,"No but after living here for several years high counts of allergens tend to have an effect on me, even if it's very slight in comparison people who actually have allergy issues. "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:20 PM",No,*to people
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:39 PM",Yes,Gotcha. Yeah when it's really bad here sometimes it affects me. It's rare though. My poor father is asthmatic and allergic to all sorts of pollens and pet dander and such. The poor guy was always having issues while he was here.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:40 PM",No,Yeah. My son is the same way. I feel like moving him would be better for his health. Yet another reason why I'm not sold on San Antonio. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:45 PM",Yes,Do recall what the situation is in Washington?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:47 PM",No,"Very clean. The biggest problems are mold and mildew, but that's easy enough to control in your house and is mostly present in high numbers in the forests where it's aiding in the decomposition of trees and undergrowth. My sisters both have intense allergy issues here that they never struggled with in WA. "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:48 PM",No,"Plus, there aren't any cockroaches in WA, and that's actually one of the most common allergy problems here. Little known fact..."
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 12:59 PM",Yes,One more thing I hate about Florida. At my grandparents house you can actually here them creeping around at night when the lighs are off. They're so frickin' big!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 12:59 PM",No,"That's disgusting. Not many bugs give me the willies, but cockroaches, especially of the winged variety, aren't easy for me to stomach. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:14 PM",Yes,And centipedes?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:15 PM",Yes,=)
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:15 PM",No,Haha yeah. But I've had bad experiences with those lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:15 PM",No,As I'm sure you could tell hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:15 PM",No,"Okay, maybe I'm not as hardcore with bugs as I pretend to be..."
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:18 PM",Yes,Haha yeah that jump when you saw the centipede on that guys arm was kinda adorable. I'm not good with bugs either. But I also don't like killing them. So I try to capture them I some sort of container to take them outside. As long as they don't touch me I'm usually good.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:19 PM",Yes,I caught a spider in my armpit once. I ended up grabbing it and throwing it across the room. Scared me half to death.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:45 PM",No,Hahaha yeah I jumped pretty high. I've knocked cockroaches off my arm and leg before. That was not fun. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:46 PM",No,"My mom captured a scorpion in our house last night. Honestly, I probably would have killed it myself if I found it. Just because of the kids and the animals. "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:46 PM",No,And I've been stung by a scorpion before. That was not fun. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:49 PM",Yes,I'm sure it wasn't. I watched a video the other day of these guys who purposely got a scorpion to sting one of them so they could shoot it in slow motion. The guy ended up getting stung a few times. And after he was describing how the venom was affecting his system.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:52 PM",No,Yeah my leg got crazy swollen and turned this nasty shade of vermillion purple. It was rather painful. I don't know why anyone would subject themselves to that on purpose. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:54 PM",Yes,I've always been particularly sensitive to ant and bee stings. Which is why I rarely ever go outside without socks. I remember one time I got stung by a bee in between my eyes. I was like 6 or so. I couldn't see very well for days. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 1:55 PM",Yes,Vermillion purple. Now that's a color.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:56 PM",No,It was quite a color. And it felt the same color too. Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 1:57 PM",No,I got stung by a bumblebee once. I still have a scar on my arm from that. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:00 PM",Yes,We're gonna have two swap some bodily harm stories sometime lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:01 PM",Yes,I have a feeling you're going to 1up me though.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:01 PM",Yes,*to
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:01 PM",No,Not on purpose haha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:03 PM",No,Why do you think I'd one up you though? Do I already seem that way? Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:08 PM",Yes,I'm getting a bit of that vibe from you lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:07 PM",No,Aw man
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:09 PM",Yes,Although I do have a couple stories where I cheated death.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:10 PM",Yes,Or was totally surrounded in angels.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:09 PM",No,I don't have any of those. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:09 PM",No,"See, you've beat me there!"
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:12 PM",Yes,Yeah but I'm sure you have a lot more.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:12 PM",No,Only cause I'm an ancient relic lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:13 PM",Yes,Oh you stop it. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:12 PM",No,Hahaha it's my way of justifying having so many stories lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:14 PM",No,"And if it ever does seem like I'm trying to one-up, just let me know. It's incredibly unintentional. I'm just trying to relate, but do that very awkwardly. Unfortunately. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:18 PM",Yes,Likewise. I feel like we share quite a few...
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:18 PM",Yes,I'm not quite sure what to call them.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:19 PM",No,Quirks?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:20 PM",Yes,"Yeah, I guess that fits alright."
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:20 PM",Yes,I gotta clean myself up for work. But I'll spam you on my 30 haha.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:22 PM",No,Haha okay. Looking forward to the spamming then. 😁
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:23 PM",Yes,I check under my covers every single night before bed to check for bugs. Random thought.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 2:23 PM",Yes,We'll not so random. Actually on topic
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:23 PM",No,That's pretty smart. And definitely on topic. Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 2:23 PM",No,I do the same thing though lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 3:57 PM",Yes,Right? You never know what could be hiding in there. I once had a spider crawl out of a toilet I was sitting on! Ahh!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 3:58 PM",No,Yikes. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 3:58 PM",No,I check because I've had ants in the bed before. It totally ruined my stay at the beach. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,I've never had anything like that happen. Did you notice them before you got into bed?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:16 PM",No,"Thankfully, yes. And they were huge. Fortunately it was a rental condo and not a home that belonged to me. But I slept on the couch for three nights instead. Even after washing the sheets lol"
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:18 PM",No,There's nothing worse than feeling like bugs are crawling on you. 🐜🐜🐜
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:19 PM",Yes,*Shudder*
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Haha yeah
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:18 PM",No,How's work?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,Chill... It's so nice not having to be rushing around worried about getting a million things done.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:21 PM",No,Is it slow this week?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,"And I got to learn some new stuff. Haha we were having a walk today. And Jimmy was walking around with them. He saw me and called me over and asked me to something for one of the aisles. And since he was with the ""walkers"" I said, ""consider it done sir."" Haha I guess I was just trying to make us look good lol. But I had no idea what he wanted me to do haha! So I ended up tracking down Raquel to have her teach me."
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,Slow today. Sat was busy if I recall correctly
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:25 PM",No,"Haha nice. There's nothing wrong with wanting to learn new things. I'm sure the weekends will remain busy for the rest of the summer, what with Six Flags being right there and all. "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Do you still have this Thursday off?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,I do.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:30 PM",No,"Not to be too forward haha, but do you have plans yet? I'm free after 7:30. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,I had talked with Reggie about possibly doing something. So we could do a group thing. I could see who else is free Thurs. Or you and I could hang out Friday? I'll check with him to see what is up. I just don't want to blow him off if he still wanted to hang out with me.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,"If not, I'm all yours lol."
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:39 PM",No,"Haha Friday is fine too. I just wasn't sure what your work schedule was like. Don't blow him off, if he wants to hang out, by all means, spend some time with him and we can do something on Friday. "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:40 PM",No,"Thursday would be an early night for me anyway, I've got work Friday, and we both know how easy it is to stay up way past a reasonable hour lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,I think we're getting better at it haha. We went from 6 to 4 lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:41 PM",No,Haha that's true
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 8:43 PM",Yes,Which reminds me. Are you interested in seeing Godzilla? We were going to see it Friday the 16th when it came out. I think we're going to get everyone's ticket around the same time so we can sit together. And I could pick up one for you. Of course I would confirm with you when we actually get them.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 8:44 PM",No,Yeah that'd be cool!
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:14 PM",Yes,So chalk body outline and caution tape on Matt and Sarah's doorstep? Best idea? Or best idea?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:15 PM",No,Hahaha yes! 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:16 PM",Yes,I gotta find some caution tape. lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:16 PM",Yes,Where could I get that decently cheap.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:16 PM",No,Hmmmm maybe party city? 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:17 PM",No,Home Depot! $6.73 for the roll. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,Gasp
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,You and I are in sync I just looked at that
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:18 PM",No,I think fake blood would be worth it as well 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:19 PM",No,Or is that going too far? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,I thought about that. However would that stain? Plus we have covered porches so rain wouldn't really gt to it
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,But no I think blood is a great idea. I just don't want to jack up the porch lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:20 PM",No,"It shouldn't stain, no. And what if the blood was a trail leading up to their door? "
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:20 PM",No,Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:21 PM",Yes,Haha yes ok
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:21 PM",No,"Could even write ""help me"" in blood on the door..."
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",No,That might freak Sarah out though lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",Yes,You are so bad!
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",Yes,I love it!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",No,How could you guarantee they wouldn't interrupt the prancing process though?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",No,*pranking
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:23 PM",Yes,I thought I was about to learn some new slang lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:22 PM",No,Hahaha nope. No reindeer here lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:23 PM",Yes,Maybe writing help where the outline of the hand is.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Ooh that's better
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Bloody handprint on the door at least?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:25 PM",Yes,You really want to put stuff on the door don't you. I'm just afraid of management seeing that on the door.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:25 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Hahaha it'll wash off easily enough. And would you do it at night or during the daytime?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:26 PM",No,And wouldn't the caution tape be a red flag for management anyway? Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:26 PM",No,If the blood is too much we can go with chalk and tape. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,I'm gonna do it whenever you're over here. I'm not doing this alone lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:26 PM",No,Well that's a two-person job anyway. How else would you do the chalk outline? Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",Yes,I'm pretty flexible lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",Yes,I'll just make sure they're at work. Kris usually knows where Matt is at.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Gotcha 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Did they say anything about the kite?
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,If only I had a key to they're apartment. See what I need to do is get really close with them so we can become key buddies.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Hahaha Sarah wouldn't let that happen haha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Haha no he didn't. I eventually asked him about it and he said that he thought everyone got one lol.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,She's pretty smart and would smell a rat early on. 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Bwahahahaha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Free kite? 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:30 PM",No,That's hilarious!
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:32 PM",Yes,I need to figure out how to get one of those chirping things in their apartment.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:32 PM",Yes,Maybe I could Trojan horse it.
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:32 PM",Yes,But then they would prolly catch on.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Yeah. Probably. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:34 PM",Yes,(´･Д･)」
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:34 PM",No,What is that? Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,I think it's a stressed emoticon. Lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:35 PM",No,Hahaha from where? Its using a Russian letter for the nose.

+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:37 PM",Yes,A penguin? lol they're little people faces.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:37 PM",No,I'm curious to see what you're seeing haha cause I don't think we're seeing the same thing lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:37 PM",Yes,The first guy is running. The second one has his arms up in the air all happy.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:38 PM",No,Hahaha okay okay
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:38 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:39 PM",No,Yeah we're seeing the same thing lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:39 PM",No,It looked like a bird to me hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:39 PM",Yes,I prolly just have an eye for it because I see that sort of stuff a lot in my japanese dealings.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:39 PM",No,Probably. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:39 PM",Yes,The Japanese keyboard on the iPhone has a crap ton of these text emoticons built into it.
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:40 PM",No,I found a hardcover manga of Nausicaa today on Amazon. It was drawn and written by the artist who did the movie. Bought it super fast. I bet the artwork is gorgeous. 
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes,かわいいえもじです！！（≧∇≦）
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,Haha ok I'm done lol
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,You'll have to let me see it!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Hahaha yeah... I don't even know what that is lol
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:41 PM",No,I totally will! 
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:42 PM",No,"He wrote it in the 80s and 90s and it was originally released in seven books, but they compiled it all into two hardcovers. I'm super excited. I love his style of artwork. It's so beautiful. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,Have you read very much manga?
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:45 PM",No,No
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:45 PM",No,Not at all haha
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:46 PM",No,"But Kailani is really artistic and loves reading graphic novels, so I try to find stuff with really good art for her to read. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:55 PM",Yes,"You know the movie One Missed Call? It's a horror. Well I was reading the Manga for it in my high school seminar. Which I guess you could equate to home room? Anyway it was in the JROTC classroom. Well when someone is doing something Maj. Smailles doesn't approve of, for example, sleeping in class. He waltz over very quietly and slams this big dense wooden rod on the table. Normally people who are paying attention catch on and cover their ears when they see him getting up from his desk. Well I was in the back of the room in a very scary and thrilling part of the book. I did not see him walk up to the sleeping person. Next thing I know I hear this huge crack at the front of the classroom causing me to jerk up and yelp. Everyone turned around and looked at me. And Maj Smailles, no longer interested in the sleeper, gives me his super ""What is wrong with you?"" glare."
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:55 PM",Yes,Sorry super long!
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:56 PM",No,"Hahaha no it's fine. And no, I don't know the movie. Horror movies are a problem for me remember? What with all the jumpiness on my part and all. "
+17069923021,"Apr 28, 2014 11:57 PM",Yes,There are lots of great mangas. Though I can't personally recommend any that would be appropriate at her age though.  
+12103557887,"Apr 28, 2014 11:58 PM",No,"Yeah, she's pretty good about knowing what she should and shouldn't be reading. If it's got anything inappropriate in it at all she'll bring it to me immediately and ask me to save it for when she's old enough to read it lol. Sometimes I miss stuff when I'm quickly skimming pages before making a purchase. "
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,Fruits Basket is suuuuuper cute. But there are some occasional jokes that are more aimed at teenagers and up.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:00 AM",No,I'll keep that in mind. She just finished an anime on netflix called Squidgirl that she thought was funny. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,OMG squidgirl!!!!
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,I've seen parts of that.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:03 AM",No,Yeah? Hahaha I didn't get to watch it with her because she went through it so fast
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:04 AM",No,I think she finished the entire season in one day. Not good. I hope I was working that day and not at home with her lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:04 AM",No,Otherwise that would make me a bad mom 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,You were prolly working. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:07 AM",No,Let's hope so haha
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:07 AM",Yes,Did we already talk about Hamtaro?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:07 AM",No,No I don't think so
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:08 AM",Yes,That should be on Netflix streaming! Such a great show. I bet she would love that.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:08 AM",No,I'll look it up for her
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:08 AM",Yes,I wonder if I could get ahold of a copy. I'd let you borrow it. It's skmething I would love to have.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:09 AM",No,It's on Amazon. Runs around $11 per season. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:11 AM",No,It's not streaming on Netflix though...
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,Yeah I know. It says volume on Amazon. That makes me think it's like 4 episodes instead of a season.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,I wonder if they released the full seasons on disk.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:14 AM",No,Ohhhh maybe yeah. But Ducktales says volume instead of season and it's the whole season. Who knows... I bet the product description would tell you. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:15 AM",Yes,There's 3 episodes per volume I just read. =\
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:15 AM",No,Oh. That's not very much then. That would be somewhat expensive. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:15 AM",No,For all of the volumes. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,Yeah I know right. I wonder if I can find the full seasons on the japan amazon site. I'm gonna check
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:17 AM",No,Would it still play on the same DVD players though? I thought they weren't the same region. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,It depends. If it's made generically for Asia then a lot of times they'll have. Region free version. Otherwise I would just rip all the episodes. Then I could burn them to a playable format.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:20 AM",No,I see. Didn't even know you could do that haha
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:22 AM",Yes,It doesn't look like they ever released the full seasons. Just those volume disks. What a shame.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:22 AM",No,How long ago was it on? Maybe they're in the process of formatting it for release. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:24 AM",Yes,It was on when I was in middle school I believe. So it's been out quite a while.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:25 AM",No,Gotcha. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:36 AM",No,"Well, I'm gonna call it a night and try to get a little more sleep than normal. Goodnight!"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:36 AM",Yes,Goodnight. Check for ants. ;D
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:36 AM",No,Hahaha already did 🐜🐜
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:06 PM",Yes,I really love the writers for Scrubs. It reminds me of Seinfeld. How so many unrelated things that are happening in the show can connect in the conclusion.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 12:08 PM",Yes,How's work going? Are you keeping everyone in line? 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:44 PM",No,Scrubs is certainly an awesome show. The first few seasons were my favorites by far. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:45 PM",No,"And work has kind of sucked today. I got drawn into some drama with my boss and a situation he's in with his wife. Suddenly he wants to be telling me his problems, and involving me in it, and I'm not okay with that at all. So that was awkward this morning. "
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 12:46 PM",No,How's your day been? 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 1:25 PM",Yes,Sorry =( sometime people just have to share. Or complain I guess. I've been on the phone with my mom for the past hour lol. I still am. I was always confused as to how my sister could spend so much time on the phone with my mom. But now that I am not living with her I understand.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 1:27 PM",Yes,Something happened to my nephew the other day. He basically hit his face on something and they had to take him to the hospital for oral surgery. He ended up getting root canals and caps. Poor little guy. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 1:42 PM",No,How old is he? That sucks. Poor thing. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:35 PM",Yes,I know. He's 2 years old! He was doing fine after. Hi fiving all the nurses. Course he was all drugged up.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:35 PM",No,Aw that's cute. At least he's doing okay now. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:36 PM",No,Will the recovery take long?
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:51 PM",Yes,I don't know. I think he's recovering pretty quickly. They were worried about insurance not paying for the whole thing. Haha I'm still on the phone with my mom.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:51 PM",Yes,I'm sneaking in a text here and there. =P
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:50 PM",No,Oh sorry
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:51 PM",No,I'm not meaning to interrupt 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:51 PM",Yes,No no your not interrupting me.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:52 PM",No,Hahaha but Mom conversations can get pretty intense lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:53 PM",Yes,Haha yes they can.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:52 PM",No,In a good way
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:53 PM",Yes,She's playing piano for me right now lol. She just got one.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:52 PM",No,That's pretty awesome! Did she already know how to play?
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 2:58 PM",Yes,She knows quite a bit about music. And she has been singing for years. And she's never actually sat down and learned piano but she is definitely impressing me right now.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 2:58 PM",No,That's cool. I've always wanted to learn to play the piano. I'm the only one in my family who doesn't play a musical instrument 😔
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,One more similarity between us. Although I heard you singing the Jurrasic park theme. ;)
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:22 PM",No,Humming. Not singing. Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:23 PM",Yes,I own an ocarina and I mess around with it occasionally. But I by no means KNOW how to play it.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:23 PM",Yes,Still involved vocal chords lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:24 PM",No,True true lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:24 PM",Yes,It was pleasant. We're you aware that I heard you?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:24 PM",No,"I used to sing for several years with the praise and worship team at my youth group, but on my own I'm very self conscious about singing. And no, I thought I was being quiet haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:26 PM",Yes,Hehe.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:27 PM",Yes,Yeah I like to sing in the shower and in the car. When I'm by myself. Or if I'm with someone I feel comfortable singing with.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:28 PM",No,I just get really self conscious. A lot. It's a problem. And then I turn bright red about everything. Even for things I shouldn't be embarrassed about. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:29 PM",Yes,I usually get embarrassed because people think I'm embarrassed.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:28 PM",No,"I try to be cool and collected, but that usually doesn't work out. Especially if someone points out that I'm blushing. Then it gets even worse haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:30 PM",Yes,Yup. I know that feel.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:31 PM",Yes,"The comment I usually get is the, ""oh you got some sun this weekend."" "
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:32 PM",Yes,And that one sets off more flushing.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:30 PM",No,"Mine is, ""man you're bright red!"" Ya think?!"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:32 PM",Yes,Haha thank you captain obvious! lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:33 PM",No,Hahahaha oh the life of a fair-skinned Caucasian. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 3:33 PM",Yes,=) I've gotten in the habit of just agreeing and changing the subject.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 3:33 PM",No,"I'll usually try to cover my cheeks, but that just draws even more attention to them lol. I still haven't learned..."
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 4:56 PM",Yes,lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 4:57 PM",Yes,Have we ever had the cliche discussion of music preferences?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 4:58 PM",No,No we haven't. I'm hard to nail down on that one too. Haha almost as hard as a movie genre 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 4:59 PM",Yes,Ha it's not easy is it. I know people who can easily rattle off a genre.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 4:58 PM",No,I like pretty much anything except most country and rap and also screamo type stuff. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 5:01 PM",Yes,"Oh my.. Screamo. That was popular amongst several of my highschool friends. Not for me though. I tend to like a lot of rap, however the rap I like tends to be vulgar so I try to avoid it."
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 5:02 PM",Yes,Oh gosh work time! I gotta clock in.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 5:02 PM",No,"I don't mind most rap, but yeah, it can get super vulgar and I really don't enjoy that. Have fun!"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,Do you remember what your first casette/cd purchase was?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:12 PM",No,Hmmm I think it was the Newsboys lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:12 PM",No,That was my first purchase with my own money anyway. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:15 PM",Yes,Haha nice. My mom would buy those for me. But I never really cared for their early music.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:16 PM",No,"I didn't have a choice. We were only allowed to listen to Christian, classical, or oldies hahaha"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:16 PM",Yes,You know that breakfast song they did?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:16 PM",No,"So, needless to say I'm a big fan of the oldies. "
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:17 PM",No,"No, I don't remember that one. It's literally been like 17 years since I listened to them. "
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:18 PM",Yes,My first was an Evanescence cd =P
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Hahaha nice
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:20 PM",No,My sister had their fist cd and listened to it nonstop for a good six months lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:23 PM",Yes,Yeah that was the one. It was only cd I owned for quite a while. I would listen to it everyday on the bus ride to school haha.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:24 PM",No,James Taylor was my #onrepeat for quite some time lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,Oh snap! Hashtag time. =P
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:24 PM",No,But he was on vinyl and not so easy to take on the bus haha
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Haha I couldn't think of a better way to say it than with a hashtag lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,=)
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,I've always wanted a portable record player lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,Could you imagine? If they made record players for being on the move?
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:27 PM",No,I'm sure they exist now. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,"They've got ""portable"" ones. But I mean like a CD player. One that is meant to be carried around lol."
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:28 PM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:29 PM",No,It has a handle... Hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:29 PM",No,Not portable enough? Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Does it have a headphone port? And does it run on batteries lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:30 PM",No,Hmmm apparently not lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:30 PM",No,"But hey, it's in a spiffy case!"
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,I know. I kinda wish I had one like that instead of the one I got.
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Which one did you get?
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,Pretty sure it's this one ￼
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,Sony one. It has a USB port so you can record it to computer
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,But I've never used it
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,The USB thing that is
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:33 PM",No,Gotcha. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:33 PM",No,I found one! 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:35 PM",No,Battery powered with a headphone port! 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,"You're too much, let me see!"
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:35 PM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:36 PM",No,It uses six AA's. Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:36 PM",No,And it's pocket sized lol
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:36 PM",No,It's a Crosley. 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:38 PM",No,A Crosley Revolution. 
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,Whaaaat. Pocket sized. That's a big pocket!
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:40 PM",No,Hahaha I was joking 
+12103557887,"Apr 29, 2014 8:40 PM",No,But it is missing the spiffy case...
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 11:02 PM",Yes,Haha. I thought you were serious.
+17069923021,"Apr 29, 2014 11:03 PM",Yes,"A, B, and Grocery tonight. They think I'm Flash or something"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,I'm guessing you went to bed. Sweet dreams then. And lots of REM.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:19 AM",No,Yeah I went to bed kinda early. I'm still having some headaches and allergy-type symptoms and I was super exhausted after all the drama at work yesterday. I really don't like conflict. \LF\LFAnd you are the Flash! Haha
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:20 AM",No,Didn't want to text you too early and accidentally wake you up either. 
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:23 AM",Yes,That's very sweet of you. I do end to just sleep right up until I have to go to class.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:23 AM",No,Yeah you've told me haha. I'm kind of the same way. 
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:25 AM",Yes,"Haha I used to take a shower before EVERYTHING. Work and school, even if it meant two showers in a day."
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:25 AM",No,I don't think I've ever been that way. One every other day is enough unless I get stinky haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:36 AM",Yes,See I've been heading more that direction. I think as I've gotten friends here I've had less time to sleep. So I cut into shower time in the morning. But you tend to smell fabulous anyway.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:36 AM",No,Do I? Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:47 AM",Yes,"Yes. and not to brag too much, but I'm quite a good judge of smells."
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 10:48 AM",No,Well thank you haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:55 AM",Yes,Ugh. I feel so dumb. I misidentified two women yesterday. >.< I called one of them sir. I was so mortified.  
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 10:59 AM",Yes,"I guess I shouldn't feel too bad? I have been called ma'am and ""lil lady"" quite a few times in my life."
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 11:00 AM",No,Hahaha I'm sorry. That's always awkward. 
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 12:17 PM",Yes,Would you like me to bring you lunch tomorrow?
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 12:23 PM",No,Sure! That would be awesome! 😁
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 12:38 PM",Yes,=D what would you like? Anything at all.
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 12:39 PM",Yes,Or would you like to answer closer to that point in time in case you're in the mood for something specific?
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 12:42 PM",No,"Not pizza or tacos haha. As long as it doesn't have beef, pork, shellfish, or raw tomatoes, you can surprise me haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 12:46 PM",Yes,"Are you sure about that? Haha. Ok. But if you change your mind and want something specific, you'll let me know?"
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 12:46 PM",No,"I don't think I'm as picky as you lol. And I like to be adventurous as much as possible. So yeah, I'm sure. "
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:08 PM",Yes,"Ok what time would be best for you? Also where is your work? And finally... Well I guess I don't have a third. I just really wanted to say ""and finally"""
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:14 PM",No,"Hahaha. Well first, I don't have any meetings, so the time doesn't really matter but I usually eat after 12:00. Second, my work address is 10333 Broadway, SA, TX, 78217. And finally, when you turn into the parking lot you'll have to go behind the buses to get to the place to park for the offices. *footnote: for further instruction feel free to let me know"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:20 PM",Yes,"Question: If I drive a bus, am I allowed to park where the busses are?"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:20 PM",Yes,Just for future reference.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:20 PM",No,"Possibly, but I think there might be assigned parking for the buses as well haha"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:23 PM",Yes,Aww ok. Yeah I might end calling you when I get there lol.
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:25 PM",Yes,"Oh you know that guy I told you about that complimented my enunciation? I keep seeing him all the time now. Last night he walked past me, stopped, and peeked his head around the corner asking if I slept on a cot in the back lol."
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:48 PM",No,Hahahaha you've got a stalker? Lol too funny
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:48 PM",No,And you are more than welcome to call. I'll meet you downstairs anyway. I wouldn't expect you to navigate the maze on your own haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:51 PM",Yes,You could leave a trail of peanuts. That might be fun... And tasty.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:52 PM",No,"Not on these floors lol. We may have custodians, but I wouldn't trust that!"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:52 PM",Yes,Haha good point.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:54 PM",No,"I mean, no offense to my employers, but it's a public school district, not a private one lol"
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:56 PM",Yes,Haha. I'm not really in the habit of eating food off the floor anyways.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:56 PM",No,That's a good practice to follow lol
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 1:57 PM",Yes,We'll not since the highschool days. I liked to live a little more dangerously back then.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 1:57 PM",No,Well we are all indestructible in high school anyway...
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 2:04 PM",Yes,So how's work? More drama? Or have you been free of that today.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 2:23 PM",No,"It's been okay. My boss has been calling me all day trying to chat it up, but I'm really uncomfortable with him now, so it's hard for me to not be short with him. "
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:15 PM",Yes,"Eh, that's sounds awkward. How do you handle that? Just tell him your in the middle of something?"
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 3:15 PM",No,"Yeah, I haven't figure out yet how to tell him to leave me alone. "
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 3:16 PM",No,I'm hoping that he'll eventually get the hint.  
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:17 PM",Yes,That's hard. What is he supposed to be doing?
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 3:18 PM",No,Working. But he seems intent on just wanting to be my friend. 
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:26 PM",Yes,"Stuff like this makes me want to perform experiments. Like setting up a remote control speaker near him that subtlety plays an annoying hum. And you could trigger it the entire time he was being ""annoying""."
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 3:27 PM",No,Pull a Pavlov on him?
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:27 PM",Yes,When I get into an office type job with other people I am going to start conditioning people immediately.
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:27 PM",Yes,"Yes, more or less"
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 3:27 PM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 3:58 PM",Yes,So I have to ask about the raw tomatoes. Do you just not like them?
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:03 PM",No,The texture is weird haha
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:09 PM",No,"And sometimes if they're too acidic, they kind of burn my mouth a little "
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:16 PM",Yes,I agree. The texture thing.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:15 PM",No,And the seeds remind me of fish eggs haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:17 PM",Yes,Haha have you ever had caviar?
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:17 PM",No,Nope. Even though my family is Russian. Can't make myself do it. 
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:21 PM",Yes,You're not missing anything. Caviar is better fertilized and aged.
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:22 PM",No,To help grow the corn? Lol
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:24 PM",Yes,Haha what? No so they turn into fish. Wait wut??
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:25 PM",Yes,Corn❓
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:24 PM",No,Like how the Indians taught the Pilgrims to use fish as fertilizer for the corn crops haha 
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:24 PM",No,Sorry 
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:27 PM",No,I took it a step further than you lol
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:43 PM",Yes,"Haha, that's amazing. I do fancy myself some fertilized corn as well."
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:45 PM",Yes,That was an awesome reference. Right over my head and out of the park. lol
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 4:47 PM",No,It wasn't that great lol
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 4:49 PM",Yes,well I liked it lol
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 5:24 PM",No,Haha fair enough
+12103557887,"Apr 30, 2014 8:08 PM",No,￼It already came today. And it's massive. It probably weighs 7 pounds. As much as one of my cats! Haha
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,That's gorgeous!
+17069923021,"Apr 30, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Can I see pages?
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 9:53 AM",No,"Fell asleep at 10 last night again. These allergies are kicking my butt. I brought the book with me to work, so you'll be able to see it today. It pretty cool! "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 10:17 AM",Yes,Do you remember having this much trouble with them last year? And yay! 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 10:18 AM",No,"No, it's never been this type of a problem before. "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 10:23 AM",Yes,I thought maybe the reason is was happening to me this year was because this was my first Spring up here near Helotes. But now I'm leaning towards it's just bad this year. Ugh
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 10:23 AM",No,Yeah. It's been a bad year. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 10:24 AM",Yes,Are you still having the headaches?
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 10:23 AM",No,Yeah I am. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 10:24 AM",Yes,=(
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 10:23 AM",No,It's okay haha
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 10:27 AM",Yes,"Raquel actually asked me if ""everything was alright"" a couple days ago. Stupid pollen. Making us all pitiful and stuff lol."
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 10:30 AM",No,Yeah very pitiful. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 11:30 AM",Yes,I'm aiming for 1230-1 if that's ok.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 11:30 AM",Yes,Just as a head up.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 11:29 AM",No,Yeah that's fine. I'm just here. Haha
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 12:36 PM",Yes,Right as I get close. lol ￼
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 12:36 PM",No,Yeah that's always fun. Should I go downstairs? You'll turn right into the parking lot on the right where the buses are. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 5:08 PM",Yes,"I swung by work to see if Kris was able to get his shift switched. So while we were talking this little boy runs up to Kris and says, ""Excuse me Mr Target man!"" Then he grabs Kris's hand and starts dragging him over to the video games. It was so adorable!"
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 5:08 PM",No,Haha cute
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:26 PM",Yes,"Then he came up to me while I was playing a game and said, ""ok I'm gonna play now."" So I handed him the controller. Then he handed me the DVD he was holding saying, ""here hold this."""
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:27 PM",No,Nice
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:27 PM",Yes,Haha I felt a little weird since I'm not dressed in red. Haha
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:27 PM",Yes,"I said, ""ok how about we just set your DVD down right here."" And I payed it on the counter."
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:27 PM",No,Some kids are special lol
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:28 PM",Yes,"And he's like, ""how do I play now?"""
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:28 PM",Yes,I I paused it for him and the. He started talking to me about it.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:29 PM",No,I bet he gives his parents a hard time. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:30 PM",Yes,"Yeah, the whole time I was hoping his parents weren't thinking I was some weirdo talking to their kid. "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:30 PM",Yes,Who's this bearded creeper chatting up our son lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:31 PM",No,Yeah if they know their kid they wouldn't be worried about it. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:33 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:34 PM",No,That's a good movie. 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:36 PM",No,Have you seen Legend? With Tom Cruise? It's possibly the only movie I like him in. And not cause he's in it. But because it's an awesome movie. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,I don't think I have lol. Do you have it?
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,Can we just spend all day watching movies sometime lol.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,We need to catch each other up on movies.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:53 PM",No,I'm pretty sure I do. And yes. That's fine with me lol
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,Mostly me lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:54 PM",No,Haha I guess 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 6:54 PM",No,I think it'll be several days though. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:02 PM",Yes,Ugh I spent way too much time at target
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:04 PM",No,Haha probably 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:21 PM",Yes,Oh hey you can come over if you want. I think Reggie is going to come hang out at nine. I'm still waitin to hear back from Kelli. So we could just watch a movie/puzzle. And then play a game if people show up lol. Or we could go find some caution tape somewhere.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:21 PM",Yes,I need to spruce my apartment a bit lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:23 PM",No,Did you have plans for tomorrow yet? This allergy crap is killing me and I'm at the point where I'm probably gonna pop a NyQuil and pass out early. Could we do something tomorrow instead?
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:26 PM",No,"I don't want to skip out, but I want to beat this thing before it gets worse, ya know?"
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:38 PM",Yes,I kinda agreed to do something with Kris tomorrow after he got off work at 9. Just cause I thought we'd be doing something tonight. Doh! Sorry. Of course you are still welcome over. But Kris was asking about binge gaming a specific game. So at 10 we would prolly start playing that.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:38 PM",Yes,Would you want to chill before then? 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:38 PM",No,I get off at 4 so I could come straight over. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,Ugh now I feel bad =(. Cause I would have told him no to binge gaming had I know. You weren't coming over tonight.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,That is in no way your fault by the way.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,Yeah come over right when you get off!
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,=D
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:40 PM",No,Don't feel bad about it though. He's your friend and you guys should spend time together. 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:42 PM",No,"And I already know what we can do, so it'll be good. "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:43 PM",Yes,We do still have a puzzle to finish haha.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:42 PM",No,Haha yeah that 500 piece mess lol
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:46 PM",Yes,Do you like puzzles? I could pick up a nice puzzle sometime that we could work on. One that has several color variations that wouldn't feel like torture haha.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:51 PM",No,"I haven't done a ton of puzzles, but I have fun doing them. Haha. I like challenging my brain as much as possible. "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:54 PM",Yes,Have I showed you my Rubik's cubes yet?
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 7:54 PM",Yes,I don't remember
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 7:57 PM",No,No you haven't. I've never been able to get those things down though. I guess I struggle with that type of abstract visual thinking or logic. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:04 PM",Yes,I could teach you if you want. Just takes some memorization for the 3x3. Then after you play around with it enough your perception of it starts to grow. Then you can start to figure out the larger ones using the concepts you discover on the 3x3.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:04 PM",Yes,I don't know if I've told you but I love 3 dimensional puzzles.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:05 PM",No,Haha sounds complex 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:05 PM",Yes,Anything that tests my spatial reasoning gets me.. Excited haha.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:05 PM",No,Excited? Haha
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Ok so Matt and Sarah good idea?￼
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Haha I almost wrote hot and bothered but I thought that might not be appropriate. Even though I just said it now.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:07 PM",No,Where would you write that? In the white area? 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:10 PM",No,It'd be funny if you did the for sale sign with the caution tape and chalk body outline. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,"Wait what? No I mean instead of ""excited"" lol"
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,About the puzzles.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,I thought about that. But I also want to be be able to have multiple pranks in my pocket.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",No,"Oh hahaha I thought you were going to say ""For Sale by Owner - Hot and Bothered"". I was confused lol"
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,I'm gonna get Matts number from Kris and write it on the sign.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",No,Oh geez he'll kill you hahah
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,no no lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:12 PM",No,Yeah it didn't make a lot of sense to me lol
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,So after I left your work and I got to target I totally scarfed the leftover pasta.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,I just got super hungry all of a sudden
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Haha you were at my office for a while
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:21 PM",Yes,I should have offered you more! Although it was pretty cold lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:21 PM",No,Haha no I was full. It was good. 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:23 PM",No,Thank you. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,I'm glad. I was a little worried haha. Did you like the flavor of the pesto? This one seemed a bit weak. And very oily. When I make it it's a bit more potent.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,It was completely my pleasure.
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,Your welcome
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:24 PM",No,Yeah it was good. I bet it's better when it's fresh from the kitchen and piping hot lol
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:25 PM",No,"I was surprised when you said you got it at Little Italy. Honestly, that's my favorite Italian restaurant here and not many people have heard of it. "
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:30 PM",Yes,"Really? That's cool how I ended up there then. Once I got set on Italian. I started reading menus. And a lot of them had this ""New York"" feel to them. Little Italy was the one menu I read that seemed the most authentic. And didn't have that New York Italian feel."
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Yeah that's why I like it lol 
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:31 PM",No,The Mom and Pop feel is nice 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,Have you ever had Arrabbiata sauce? Is like a spicy red sauce.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:35 PM",No,Yeah. Theirs is pretty good. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,I've never actually had it.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:38 PM",No,No? It's good if it's done right and isn't too spicy. The heat counteracts the acidity of the tomatoes. Pretty yummy. 
+17069923021,"May 1, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,I'd like to try it sometime. My stomach is pretty sensitive to tomato sauce though.
+12103557887,"May 1, 2014 8:41 PM",No,It might be too much then haha
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 10:33 AM",Yes,They got me last night ￼￼
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:34 AM",No,Shrink wrap? That's awesome! Hahaha
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:34 AM",No,"Caution tape and chalk body it is. And at this point, I'm thinking you're gonna have to go with the fake blood. "
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:34 AM",No,But maybe do one more small one first with the for sale sign. 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 10:36 AM",Yes,Haha i sorta retaliated right after I found my car. ￼
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 10:37 AM",Yes,Fake blood does sound like a good idea now. I'm still waiting for you though. I'm not doing that one without you.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:38 AM",No,Hahaha that was fast. We'll have to stock up on the product and wait for them to retaliate once again. 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 10:45 AM",Yes,Haha but it took them such a long time for that!
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 10:45 AM",Yes,I don't know if I can wait for them lol.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:46 AM",No,It'll take some time to get the stuff together lol be patient 
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 10:47 AM",No,"Besides, you retaliated pretty quickly, maybe they'll get the hint haha"
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:17 AM",No,"Okay, question.... Pasta or potatoes? "
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:18 AM",Yes,Haha uh.. Prolly more so potatoes. But it depends on how they're prepared
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:19 AM",No,Twice baked?
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:31 AM",Yes,I'm not sure. I don't think I've had twice baked.
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:31 AM",Yes,"And Kris says ""Waazzzzzzuuuuup"""
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:32 AM",No,Hahaha 
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:32 AM",No,Hi to Kris
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:33 AM",No,Okay well I don't want to ask too many more questions about food. Don't want to give anything away. 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:43 AM",Yes,Wait why?? Haha
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:42 AM",No,Nope. Not saying anything. 
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:44 AM",No,I've already said too much lol
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,Yes you have. lol I think I know what's going on.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:46 AM",No,Do you?
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:48 AM",Yes,I think your writing a biography on me and currently you're planning the food section.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:49 AM",No,Close. I was trying to figure out if you'd prefer to throw pasta or potatoes at Matt's front door. 
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:50 AM",No,"While pasta would stick better, twice baked potatoes would make a more definitive thumping sound. "
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:50 AM",Yes,Potatoes would definitely stick longer haha
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:51 AM",Yes,Wait wait 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:51 AM",Yes,Pasta stick longer?
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:51 AM",Yes,How long have we cooked the pasta?
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:51 AM",No,Al dente. But with no extra oil or butter added so it's sticky. 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 11:52 AM",Yes,Oh wait are these potatoes mashed?
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 11:51 AM",No,"They're baked then mashed, and stuck back in a potato skin and baked again. With lots of cheese. "
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 1:25 PM",Yes,That sounds tasty.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 1:25 PM",No,Yeah they're good. 
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 2:26 PM",Yes,"Ok random brain puzzle of the day. Last night I left a glass out that had a little bit of milk in the bottom. This morning when I found it there was just a circle of dry milky residue. Now the question. Sometimes when I've seen this happen, the circle of dry milk at the bottom is a smooth gradient. However sometimes, this case for example, the residue is in rings. What are your thoughts on what causes rings to develop instead of a smoother film?"
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 2:27 PM",Yes,I have my theory I'm just curious as to how you approach it.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 2:26 PM",No,The amount of salt in the milk or the amount of calcium in the glass. I guess. I never took chemistry though haha
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 2:30 PM",Yes,I wonder if the internet knows.
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 2:29 PM",No,It's a possibility haha
+12103557887,"May 2, 2014 4:02 PM",No,Heading your way. If that's okay...
+17069923021,"May 2, 2014 4:07 PM",Yes,Wow I totally lost track of time lol. Yes that's fine.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 12:19 PM",Yes,"Hey, last night was fun and delicious. Thank you"
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 12:31 PM",No,You're welcome! Did you eat the cake yet?
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 12:36 PM",Yes,I had a large slice right after you left. It was really good. I'm still a little fuzzy on how it was made with no eggs lol
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 12:37 PM",No,It was the baking soda and vinegar combination. Lol
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 4:58 PM",Yes,After I get through finals we need to actually have a movie marathon day. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 4:58 PM",Yes,So many movies until we puke.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 4:58 PM",Yes,Well maybe not that bad.
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 5:56 PM",No,"Like I said last night, it'll probably need to be several themed days to get through all of that content. Haha. And I'm not great with vomit haha. "
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 5:56 PM",No,"But a movie day, or several, is right up my alley. "
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 8:07 PM",Yes,Yeah I'm not either.and I've spent that much time watching movies before. To the point where I'm queasy.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,And did you by chance want to try another church tomorrow?
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Which one did you have in mind?
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 8:32 PM",Yes,I actually didn't have one in mind. Let me retry that question lol. Did you have another one you wanted to try? I haven't looked around yet. But I will start looking this week.
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Hmmm let me think about it for a second. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,I mean if not that's ok. I obviously didn't prepare. I sadly kept it on my back burner.
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 8:38 PM",No,Well I'll try to think of one but I didn't have any immediate curiosities. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:24 PM",No,What?!?! Is that right now?!
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:24 PM",No,That sucks. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:26 PM",Yes,Yes it's insane
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:26 PM",Yes,I'm helping the. Out
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:26 PM",No,That's nice of you
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:32 PM",Yes,I do try to left my quota lol.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,I like to think I'm nice all the time but I'm not too sure on that.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:39 PM",Yes,Did you have a nice Saturday?
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:40 PM",No,Yeah it's been fun. You?
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes,Hopefully a relaxing day off?
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes, Well I did have to work.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes,"But other than that yes, quite nice"
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:40 PM",No,Yeah. I got to sleep in a bit. So that was good. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,I hope you didn't feel kicked out last night.
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:45 PM",No,No I didn't. I needed to get home anyways. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,"Ok, I just wanted to make sure you didn't feel pressured to leave."
+12103557887,"May 3, 2014 11:54 PM",No,No not at all. 
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:57 PM",Yes,Well you are on the list of people who are always welcome. Just so you know.
+17069923021,"May 3, 2014 11:58 PM",Yes,Now I'm prolly gonna head to bed. Soo goodnight.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 12:02 AM",No,Alright. Goodnight!
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:39 AM",Yes,"May the fourth be with you, ￼"
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 3:30 PM",No,"Sorry, my friend got baptized this morning and I found out about it at the last minute. I've been with her for most of the day. Happy fourth to you as well! And if you ever have a bad feeling about anything, just use the force!"
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 3:35 PM",Yes,I usually try to keep my use of the force limited to opening doors. And congratulations to her! 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 3:35 PM",No,Well sometimes doors can give bad feelings too. Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 3:45 PM",Yes,I think sometimes we hurt doors' feelings. That's why I try to avoid automatic doors as much as possible. I don't want the manuals to feel lonely and rejected.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 5:21 PM",No,Yeah the manuals need some love too. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,I just got confetti egged by Matt and Sarah...
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 8:38 PM",No,On your person? Or your place of residence? Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 8:57 PM",Yes,"On my person. I heard my doorbell ring. I saw Matt through the window and thought, ""uh oh."" So I opened the door. Only Matt as there. So I slowly peeked around the corner for Sarah. Then she jumped me with confetti egg."
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 8:58 PM",No,Hahahaha nice
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 8:58 PM",No,"Well, they've retaliated now lol"
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 9:12 PM",Yes,Alright. We just need fake blood then.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 9:12 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 9:12 PM",No,Party city...
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 9:13 PM",Yes,Are you sure we should do that? I don't want them to have to work to hard to clean it up.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 9:14 PM",No,Fake blood should wash right off. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 9:14 PM",No,Especially with a little soap. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,Ok how about I leave a little scrubby and some soap in a little basket with a ribbon.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,I feel so bad making a mess.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:44 PM",No,That would be nice of you haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:45 PM",Yes,"And a little note that says, ""please use me on the blood stains. Sorry for the inconvenience."""
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:46 PM",Yes,Did you do anything Star Wars related today?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:46 PM",No,That's going too far hahaha I'm banning the note 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:46 PM",No,I had a Star Wars dream last night lol
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:47 PM",Yes,What?? You can't make me!
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:46 PM",No,I watched A New Hope
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,I was actually planning on watching that today. And am still considering it. Even though it's late and I have a finally tomorrow.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,What was your dream about?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:48 PM",No,Do it! 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:48 PM",No,Living on a moisture farm haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:51 PM",Yes,"Haha, anything else? Stuff that happened?"
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:52 PM",No,Just trying to negotiate the sale of the moisture to the Jawas haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:55 PM",Yes,I don't even know how to respond. That's amazing.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:54 PM",No,Hahaha why? 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:57 PM",Yes,You're so dorky. I love it.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:57 PM",No,Oh hahaha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:58 PM",Yes,Did you happen to see anything on Facebook about my dream last night?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 10:59 PM",No,Yeah. And how everyone thought you were actually bitten by a real alligator because of the way you worded it. Haha 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 10:59 PM",Yes,Ha!
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:01 PM",Yes,"I don't think I ever told you this. But I had a dream about you, Eli, and I quite a while ago haha."
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:01 PM",Yes,This was actually my second dream with Eli lol.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:01 PM",No,Really? Uhhhhh Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:04 PM",No,And how long ago was this? Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,Haha. It was in the future. And we were in some sort of military. We were in charge of this small outpost in the middle of the desert. We were the only ones there. And in my dream we were cleaning it. And there were rooms in this outpost that had no gravity. Lol
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:04 PM",No,Hahaha what? 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:04 PM",No,Is that cause of the time we all cleaned that spill between A and B block?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,Um.. I think it was a few months after you started at target
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:05 PM",Yes,Haha I'm not sure.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:05 PM",No,That's a long time ago. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:05 PM",Yes,Yeah I know lol
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:06 PM",Yes,We were mostly sweeping up sand. But if I recall you called me into one of the bathrooms to help you scrub the walls.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:06 PM",No,With a toothbrush? Lol
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:06 PM",Yes,They weren't toothbrushes but they were small! Lol
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:06 PM",No,Hahahaha nice
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",Yes,I think I had another dream about you before but I don't remember what it was about.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",Yes,I do however remember the other one with Eli. Because that one was buzzard
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",No,Really? 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",Yes,Bizarre 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",No,There were vultures in it? lol
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",Yes,Haha no
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",No,I saw the correction haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",Yes,Stinkin' autocorrect
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:09 PM",No,Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:10 PM",No,It can be awesome from time to time though. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:11 PM",Yes,Yes is cannibalism
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:11 PM",Yes,Ah. I screwed that one up.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:11 PM",Yes,That was supposed to be it
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,Do you want to hear about the other dream with Eli? haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,It's not as weird as the drugged up Saran wrapped alligators.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Haha sure
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,But it's still odd
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Naturally
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:13 PM",Yes,We all worked in a grocery store. It was cabana themed. And almost all of our products were kept in old crates and barrels.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:16 PM",Yes,And Eli had been training to work in our deli. Deli is an odd way to put it. But that's what it was in my dream. We had our own slaughterhouse. And when someone completed they're training for the deli we held a ceremony of sorts.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:16 PM",No,With candles and everything? Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,No candles. Everyone stood in a room surrounding Eli and a table with a boar tied to it. And the ceremony was Eli killing the boar with a chainsaw.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,o_O
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Uhhhhhh 😱
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Which I slowly backed away from as it was happening.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Because I was super grossed out and slightly appalled.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,But it was like a normal occurrence in my dreamworld.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,You were so not expecting that ending were you.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,I am so sorry!
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:20 PM",No,Hahaha it's okay. Everyone has different kinds of dreams. Mine are typically less......horrific hahaha
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:20 PM",No,Do you see people's faces when you dream?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:23 PM",Yes,I think so. I definitely do when it's someone I know. That's kind of an odd question. Why? Do you not?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:24 PM",No,"No. I never see people's faces. Typically people in my dreams don't take an actual physical shape, they're represented more by a feeling. Like I'll know it's them because I get the sense it's them, not because I saw it was them. "
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,I wonder why that is. Is it just people or do other objects sort of abstract?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:28 PM",Yes,I definite know the feeling thing though. I don't recognize people by they're looks. I usually have sort of unique emotional feeling or connection to them.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:29 PM",No,I think that typically my dreams are pretty abstract haha. But it's mostly just people. Or there will be a body/physical form but I don't have to see the face to know who it is. Basically I never look at the faces of the people in my dreams. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,You said you can lucid dream right?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Yes. All the time. It used to just be with nightmares. But now I'm almost always aware of the fact that I'm dreaming.  
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,I wonder if there's a correlation there. Because my dreams are usually very vivid and concrete. But I never realize I'm dreaming unless it's a nightmare. And even then I can't control it. I can only wake myself up.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:33 PM",No,Maybe. It would be interesting if those two things are connected. Do you dream in color or black and white 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:33 PM",No,?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,Color
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:34 PM",Yes,Are yours in black and white?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:34 PM",No,Sometimes. Mostly color though. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:35 PM",No,Every once in a while there won't be a ton of color. It'll be mostly black and white with a pop of color. But 95% of the time it's all color. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:36 PM",No,I'm pretty sure most people dream in black and white though. At least that's what I've read before. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:37 PM",Yes,I used to have dreams a lot where I was super sensitive to light. Or it just happened to be really bright. Like those migraine medication commercials.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:37 PM",Yes,Wait wut? Most people dream in black and white?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:37 PM",No,"From what I remember, yeah. "
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:38 PM",No,Cause I remember thinking that was weird. Cause I didn't dream in black and white. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:38 PM",No,But then I found out that most people can't lucid dream either. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:39 PM",Yes,I've never heard the black and white thing. Though I've never actually thought to ask people about the color of they're dreams. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:40 PM",Yes,I wish the inception thing was real. I would love to see what you see.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:40 PM",No,I read it in my psych class freshman year of college. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Do people speak in your dreams? No one ever talks in mine. We all communicate telepathically. Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,How old was the book? I wonder if that's different now. And if so does it have some connection to the format of the information we are exposed to.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:42 PM",No,"I mean, this was like....12 years ago Hahahaha. I'm very old lol"
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:42 PM",No,So it's probably changed 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,Haha you're not old.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,You're only 30.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:43 PM",No,I started college more than a decade ago.  
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:43 PM",No,That's old. Haha
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,Your younger than everyone in my family!
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,Are you calling my brother old?? Haha
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"I mean to say that in relation to how old I physically and mentally feel, I'm actually significantly older in measured years. "
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:47 PM",No,Do you have déjà vu often?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:49 PM",Yes,"Yes, and I've always been convinced that I could use it to my advantage to enhance my reflexes."
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:49 PM",Yes,But it's never really helped. But info already have good reflexes. Too good sometimes.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:50 PM",No,So your déjà vus have more to do with occurrences? Or with conversations?
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:50 PM",No,Mine are always conversations. 
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,Situations and occurrences. Never conversations.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,Or locations.
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,I'm seeing a theme here.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:50 PM",No,Which is?
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:55 PM",Yes,"Regarding everything we've talked about. It seems your experiences tend to deal in the abstract and are connection oriented. Communication, feeling. And in my case things are tangible and concrete. But also governed by strict rules."
+17069923021,"May 4, 2014 11:56 PM",Yes,Correct me if I'm wrong or off.
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:56 PM",No,No that seems like an accurate representation. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:56 PM",No,I have prophetic dreams as well. 
+12103557887,"May 4, 2014 11:56 PM",No,I dream about my family members before they die. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,"I believe there is a connection between people that is beyond any measurable medium we are currently aware of. Ive never had a dream like that. But I've had instances with people I'm very close to that supports this. For example, my friend the priest? I can't tell you how many times we have picked up the phone to call each other at the same exact time. And we don't call each other that often."
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,Im sorry that that is the subject of your dream though.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,=/
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:04 AM",No,It's okay. It actually helps me feel better about the whole death thing. But it's to the point when a family member will be sick and my sisters will call me to see if I dreamed about the family member or not. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:05 AM",Yes,Can we just fuse our brains together?
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:05 AM",No,And I do the same thing with my friends and family\LFtoo. Where we call or text at the same time. And often about the same thing too. 
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:06 AM",No,Fuse them together? Hahahaha
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,Haha I like your thoughts and ideas.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:06 AM",No,Hahahaha gotcha 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:09 AM",Yes,On the topic of brains. There was another reccuring dream I had as a child. I would go to this doctor and he removed my brain; promising me that I wouldn't be conscious until they put it back into my body. But after they did take it out I was conscious. But there was no input of any kind. I had no senses. I was stuck experiencing nothingness for a very long time. Most of my recurring dreams were nightmares.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:11 AM",No,That's a weird kind of debilitating sense. And as equally horrifying as being a quadriplegic I think. I think most recurring dreams are nightmares. Probably because the brain remembers what caused a particular chemical reaction and uses those same thoughts to fuel that chemical process. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,"Han just showed up, and I remembered your awesome shirt Friday."
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,Squirrel! Sorry haha
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:13 AM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:14 AM",Yes,I wish I dreamed more. I've heard certain foods influence dreaming more.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:15 AM",No,Yeah that's probably true
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:17 AM",Yes,You have work tomorrow.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:17 AM",No,I know. Haha
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:17 AM",Yes,I could talk all night with you but we both need sleep lol.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:18 AM",Yes,I have a final in the morning.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:17 AM",No,Yeah. It's time for bed. Hahaha. Good luck on the exam. Goodnight!
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,"Thank you, sweet dreams."
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 12:19 AM",No,You too
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:24 AM",Yes,I just scored some speakers from school! They look kinda cheap but that's really all I needed.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:25 AM",No,For your computer?
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:25 AM",No,How was your final?
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:25 AM",Yes,I'm gonna hook them up to my record player because currently it is speaker lacking.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:26 AM",No,Gotcha
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:26 AM",Yes,And my final kinda sucked. But my first two exams I got A's on so it shouldn't hurt me too bad.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:27 AM",No,Well maybe you'll be surprised by the grade anyway. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:28 AM",Yes,That would be nice. It has happened before. But not that often lol.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:28 AM",Yes,This guy tends to be a realistic grader though. So I can't be sure.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:29 AM",Yes,I had two fun dreams last night.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:30 AM",Yes,The one that was this morning was amazing!
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:31 AM",Yes,I had water skiis and a kite and the wind was so heavy and the waves we so big that I was getting lots of gliding time.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:32 AM",No,Hahaha I didn't dream at all last night. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:33 AM",Yes,Then at one point I grabbed my kite and it became more of a one handed hang glider. And I started gliding over the roads near this beach. I had a grappling hook that I was using to latch on to vehicles on the road. A Sort of parasailing 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:33 AM",Yes,It was so gorgeous!
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:34 AM",Yes,No dreams? =(
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:34 AM",No,Nope. I slept heavy. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:39 AM",Yes,After the traffic became sparse I slowly glided towards the beach and I landed near a large crocodile/alligator carcass. There was a young wolf there. I reached out to him but he got scared and ran into the carcass to hide. I sat there and waited for a few seconds and he came back out. Only this time he was a hippo with a melting face.(omg and I just realized why) after i reached out to let him as he was walking towards me and when we made contact he turned into a soft furry fuzzy seal. He was very playful. But then his mom came out and started acting very aggressive towards me.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:39 AM",Yes,To *pet him
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:40 AM",No,What's with all the alligators? Haha that's two nights in a row. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:40 AM",Yes,Hahaha I don't know!
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:41 AM",Yes,And something really funny I just realized. The hippo's face looked like it was made of liquid. It was sloshing around. And I have a stuffed hippo with a Picasso face! It's like this inside joke stuffed animal I've had since highschool.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:41 AM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:42 AM",No,The brain makes some weird connections. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:47 AM",Yes,"The dream before that had Matt, Sarah, Phil and my parents."
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:46 AM",No,You had a busy night lol
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:48 AM",Yes,I'll transcribe that one when I get home. If your interested. I'm at a stoplight currently
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:49 AM",No,Don't text and drive!
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 11:49 AM",No,Haha
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:55 AM",Yes,I'm a pretty firm believer in that. I'm guessing you figured that cause I'm pretty sure I've told you not to text me when your driving haha. But I do sometimes when I'm at a long light. But I'll drop my phone immediately when it turns green. Even if there's unfinished writing.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:56 AM",Yes,So don't you do it! lol
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:56 AM",Yes,Unless your at a stop light lol.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 11:57 AM",Yes,Then I'll forgive you.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 12:20 PM",Yes,"Ok so I lived with my parents and Matt and Sarah were our neighbors. My friend Phil also lived with us. My mother snuck into their house and stole this poptart shaped guitar that Sarah had. And Matt kept asking me if I stole her guitar. I finally figured out it was my mother after asking around. So I called her out on it. Over the course of that day they moved in with us. And I spent the evening hanging up Sarah's hair accessories, mostly unopened packages, on these pegs in her room. Haha it was kinda odd. I was pretty much zoning her room."
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 1:13 PM",No,That would be a funny prank if you could find a way in their apartment. Zone their stuff. Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 2:27 PM",Yes,Ha. Well the other night someone gave me the idea to write just married on the truck and hang cans from the back. But I thought it would be a good idea to pass that idea off to Matt to try on Kris next time he stays over.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 2:29 PM",Yes,Haha getting into their apartment might be crossing the line
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:18 PM",No,"Pranking Kris would be funny too hahaha. You could write a ""best boyfriend in the world"" message on Matt's truck though..."
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:18 PM",No,"And yeah, the apartment thing would be too much. I was just joking about that one. "
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:19 PM",Yes,Or we're you really? Hmmmmmm? =D
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:19 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:19 PM",No,Yes I was lol
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:21 PM",Yes,"Haha I would love to write some custom software for their computer that would do weird things. Like saying ""Excuse me"" at irregular intervals."
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:21 PM",Yes,Or making the computer automatically change their background to squirrels everytime it's restarted.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",No,After a farting sound?
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,Are that's gross no lol
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",No,"Saying ""excuse me"" that is..."
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,*Eww
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,Maybe a cough.
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",No,Or a sneeze. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 3:23 PM",Yes,"Haha bless me would be good after that, ""Oh bless me."""
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 3:22 PM",No,Yeah
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 4:50 PM",Yes,Deja vu
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 4:50 PM",Yes,Just now
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 4:50 PM",Yes,It's still going . This is a long one.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 5:50 PM",Yes,Be careful on those cinco de mayo streets tonight if you're out and about.
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 5:50 PM",Yes,People get crazy!
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 5:55 PM",No,I'm not going out haha. I just got the kids from their Dad. 
+17069923021,"May 5, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,I'm out with my argumentative friend Jordan. We're going movie adventuring!
+12103557887,"May 5, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Haha have fun!
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:03 PM",Yes,When do your Fridays start?
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:03 PM",No,After I get back from Seattle. In June. 
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:15 PM",Yes,D= that's so far off! Lol
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:17 PM",No,"Naw, it's only like a month. That'll go by quickly for me. "
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Yeah I guess you're right I thought it was gonna start near the end of the school year
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:21 PM",Yes,I've never really looked forward to summer that much. But I am looking forward to this one.
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:21 PM",No,"Well the school year doesn't end until June 6th, then the next week is a week for the schools to clean up from the year and all. The teachers start vacation on the 16th, so that's the week the Fridays start, but I'll have that week off already. So for me, Fridays will start on the 26th of June. "
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,Well you have to promise to hang out with me some of those Fridays lol. Do you have any long weekend trips planned with your kids?
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Yeah a few. I still don't know what the summer is going to look like with their Dad yet though. So those trip plans could change. 
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:33 PM",No,"It'll all depend on if he decides to sign papers finally. He's supposed to have the kids for the whole month of July, but I don't see that happening. "
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,"Man, I'm really sorry that you're dealing with that. =\"
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,What is he trying to do? I mean I know you mentioned child support. But is fighting about custody?
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:43 PM",No,"It's alright. I could still be in that mess and dealing with an entirely different problem. It's slowly getting better, bit by bit. "
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,True
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"I honestly don't know. He wouldn't get primary custody of the kids anyway, so it would be pointless for him to fight me on that. He refuses to talk to me about anything, so it's not like we're able to work through this like rational adults. But he's not rational anyway so I guess I shouldn't expect for this to be anything but excruciatingly difficult. As it has been..."
+17069923021,"May 6, 2014 11:56 PM",Yes,Well If you ever need someone to vent off at. I'm all ears. I try to make myself available for my friends.
+12103557887,"May 6, 2014 11:56 PM",No,"Haha thanks. I try not to vent too much about that kind of stuff though. I don't want to make it seem like I'm bad mouthing him or being bitter or petty. Maybe that's just me being overly cautious or private, I dunno. "
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 12:00 AM",No,"Well, I need to get back up in six hours and I've got a long day tomorrow, so I'm gonna hit the hay. Thanks for talking with me. Goodnight!"
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,Goodnight. Sleep well. 
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 12:02 AM",No,You too
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,I know this is short notice but are you free tomorrow?
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:32 PM",No,"No, I've got the kids with me this week/weekend. Sorry. Why?"
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:35 PM",Yes,I just wanted to hang out with you.
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:35 PM",No,"Oh haha yeah, I'm sorry. "
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:38 PM",Yes,It's ok.
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:39 PM",No,"And also, my Aunt is flying into town tomorrow, so I've got that too. "
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:41 PM",Yes,Oh boy. Is she staying with you all?
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:44 PM",No,Yeah for the night and then she's going with my parents to Dallas for my niece's baptism this weekend. They'll be back on Monday I think. So at least the house will be quiet this weekend. I'm gonna make blanket forts all over the place with the kids hahaha
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:45 PM",Yes,Haha that's awesome.
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:45 PM",Yes,Do you have couch cushions?
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:45 PM",No,I'm taking full advantage of the extra quiet! Haha
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:45 PM",No,"A few, but not a ton. "
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:47 PM",Yes,I miss cushion and blanket forts. Those were the days. =) your kids are gonna love it.
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:47 PM",No,"Yeah I was thinking about pitching a tent in the backyard too, but all the deer could be a problem. "
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:48 PM",No,We have deer in our neighborhood by the way haha
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,They just want to snuggle lol.
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,It might be a little warm for that too.
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:48 PM",No,Yeaaaahhhhh no snuggling with deer ticks for me. 
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:48 PM",No,And humid. 
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:54 PM",Yes,My highschool youth pastor is in San Antonio this weekend. I haven't seen him since my friends funeral last year. He messaged me asking if I was free to meet up and catch up.
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:54 PM",No,Well that sounds cool. 
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:56 PM",Yes,"Yeah, I want to see him. Idk. I'm just nervous. I get that way when I haven't seen someone in a while. "
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:57 PM",Yes,Well I should prolly get back to studying. =\
+12103557887,"May 7, 2014 10:57 PM",No,"Don't be nervous, he wanted to see you. Okay, night!"
+17069923021,"May 7, 2014 10:58 PM",Yes,Goodnight. =D
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,Im trying again.￼
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:21 PM",No,Hahaha they're awesome! 
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:22 PM",No,Enjoy it!
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:27 PM",Yes,Hopefully being older and not as antsy will make it possible for me to finish lol. I also picked up Princess Bride. I wasn't looking for it specifically. It just happened to be on the shelf right across from the Tolkien stuffs.
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:27 PM",No,The Princess Bride is funnier. It might be an easier one for you to start with. Very tongue in cheek. 
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:31 PM",Yes,Hmm. I think I'm going to attempt that one in Washington. I'll be there for quite a while. And don't imagine I'll be spending every moment of every day with my parents.
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:31 PM",No,It's a shorter read than the Tolkien books. 
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:31 PM",Yes,"I never understood that expression. I know what it means, but not why... it means..."
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:31 PM",No,Hmm I don't know really 
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:32 PM",Yes,Should I go for PBride instead then?
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:31 PM",No,For right now yes. 
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,Ok then it's decided!
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,I kinda want some popcorn. But I'm not sure that's the best idea while reading. Haha
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:35 PM",No,As long as it's not three gallons worth. 
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:38 PM",Yes,=) That was nothing. To bad I e never seen a popcorn eating challenge. I might be able to win that. I think I'm just gonna make a panini and then see how far into this book I can get tonight.
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:38 PM",Yes,I've
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:40 PM",No,"Well let me know how you like it. I just finished that one a few months ago, so it's pretty fresh still. "
+17069923021,"May 8, 2014 9:41 PM",Yes,"Is the ""Anybody want a peanut"" line in this? Or was that made up for the movie lol. I have to know."
+12103557887,"May 8, 2014 9:43 PM",No,"Uhhhhh geez I don't remember. I know Fezzik's rhyming is mentioned, but I don't remember to what degree. "
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 12:41 AM",No,I'm going to bed now lol 
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 12:41 AM",No,I don't have work in the morning so I was watching a movie. 
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 12:42 AM",No,*gasp*
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 11:03 AM",Yes,*more gasping* how are those blanket forts coming along?
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 11:05 AM",No,We're cleaning up first. So the forts probably won't start till the afternoon haha
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 11:07 AM",Yes,Omigosh! So our crime scene prank just got that much more amazing.
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,Alexis gave me this little device. It flashes blue and red LEDs! We can hang it on their peephole. =D
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 11:09 AM",No,Nice!
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 11:10 AM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 11:10 AM",Yes,Police lights!
+12103557887,"May 10, 2014 11:10 AM",No,Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 4:43 PM",Yes,I've been trying to think what else we could do.
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 4:43 PM",Yes,To them
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 4:43 PM",Yes,With regards to the crime scene
+17069923021,"May 10, 2014 4:44 PM",Yes,What other types of thing would one find at a crime scene.
+17069923021,"May 11, 2014 10:19 AM",Yes,"Hey Jessie, happy Mother's Day. =D"
+12103557887,"May 11, 2014 10:25 AM",No,Thank you!
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 6:37 PM",Yes,How was your Mother's Day?
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 6:38 PM",No,It was decent. Haha. I cuddled with the kids almost all day. Barbecued for dinner and watched A Goofy Movie and Peter Pan with the kids. Two of my Disney favs. So it was alright. How was yours?
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 6:42 PM",Yes,Ooh barbeque. Mine was kind of uneventful. I used to bake a cake for my mom each year. But that can't really happen. So slept for hours instead. Wasn't really feeling so great.
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 6:42 PM",Yes,But I did spend like 3 hours talking with her on the phone at like 2am.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 6:42 PM",No,Allergies still bugging you?
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 6:42 PM",No,Hahaha my mom didn't been wish me a happy Mother's Day. She was out of town. 
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 6:44 PM",No,So it's good that you got to talk to your mom though. 
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 7:36 PM",Yes,Actually no allergies. I think it was the fact that I was hanging out with close friends all week and then all of a sudden 4 days all by myself lol. I think I was in a sort of social crash.
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 7:37 PM",Yes,Aw. Did you call or text her?
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 7:38 PM",Yes,"I called my mom on her birthday Thursday. But she was out with her friend. So I tried calling her back Friday, the. Saturday."
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 7:38 PM",No,Well maybe your body needed the rest haha. Yeah I texted her. She didn't respond though. 
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 7:39 PM",Yes,I accidentally made this little girl scream today...
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 7:39 PM",No,Why? Lol
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 7:43 PM",Yes,I was squatting on the floor fixing some cereal boxes. Her mom came around the corner and walked last me. The. The little girl walks around the corner holding a magazine in front of her face. She walked up really close to me(really really close) and just stood there. And I looked up at her to see if she needed something. Then I realized she thought I was her mother. She didn't realize because she had the magazine so close to her face. Then all of a sudden she brings the magazine down and screamed lol. I'm sorry! Your not my mom. Then she ran out of the aisle.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 7:49 PM",No,Hahaha that's hilarious
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 8:09 PM",Yes,Definitely a first for me.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 8:10 PM",No,Making a girl scream? Or being confused for a mom because of your long hair? Haha
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,"I've made lots of girls scream, in the most appropriate of contexts, but always people I knew. Never a stranger lol."
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 8:38 PM",Yes,And also being mistaken for a mother. I've been mistaken for a girl plenty. 
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 9:05 PM",No,"Hahaha that's funny. Well, up until sophomore year in high school I was often mistaken for a little boy. If that makes you feel any better. "
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:38 PM",Yes,It does lol. Haha actually it does have it's perks. Like the time I caught this guy checking me out while I was running on post on the track. The look on his face when he realized I had a beard is a memory I hold dear.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 10:39 PM",No,Hahaha oh man that's too awesome 
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:43 PM",Yes,And that does sound like something that would happen to you lol.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 10:44 PM",No,That I would be mistaken for a little boy? Haha why?
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,"From the stories you've told me and just observing you, that seems like the type of thing that would gravitate towards you."
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,Not necessarily being mistaken for a boy. But comedic stuff in that genre.
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 10:52 PM",No,Oh haha I guess. I think it's more cause I actually looked like a prepubescent boy lol
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 10:53 PM",Yes,I'm not 100% sure on the validity of this. But I was told my entire life by my family that I was often mistaken for one of the Olsen twins as an infant.
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 10:54 PM",No,I have ID photos that look like the Hanson brothers. 
+12103557887,"May 12, 2014 10:56 PM",No,"And no, I won't try to find them. They're hidden deep in a cavernous box someplace I don't remember. I think..."
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 11:03 PM",Yes,"Dangit, I was just about to ask lo"
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 11:03 PM",Yes,L
+17069923021,"May 12, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,Or wait are you just trying to make me think you don't have access to them haha
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 11:55 AM",No,Well.... If I looked really hard I could probably find them somewhere haha
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 1:57 PM",No,"Oh, and I don't know if you're still in the market for a mannequin, but I was driving near my warehouse today and saw a place called ND Store Fixtures that had mannequins in the window. Maybe something to look into...."
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,Haha are you serious? Haha
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 3:22 PM",Yes,What road was it on?
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 3:23 PM",Yes,Redundant haha
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 3:22 PM",No,Yup. Totally serious. Broadway. Near 410. 
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 3:25 PM",Yes,And you should look hard to find your IDs
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 3:28 PM",No,Haha you wish!
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 3:29 PM",Yes,I do wish! lol. I showed you my Florida license haha.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 3:28 PM",No,Yeah well.... I honestly don't even know where they're at though. Maybe I'll find them when I move. But that doesn't guarantee you'll see them haha
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 5:42 PM",Yes,lol that's not fair. You're totally carrot dangling right now haha.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 6:25 PM",No,Hahaha sorry. 
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 7:57 PM",Yes,How could I use a mannequin against Matt and Sarah
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 7:58 PM",No,"Dress it up in silly clothes and have it hold a sign that says ""Estate Sale All Day, just knock on the door"""
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,...
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,You are an evil genius.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 7:59 PM",No,Hahaha 
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:00 PM",Yes,I almost feel like you've thought about this. How did you respond so fast? haha
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Because I thought about it when I passed by the mannequins earlier lol
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:02 PM",Yes,Haha I knew it!
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Well.... It didn't take long to think of in the first place though lol
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,Oohh.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,I just thought of a bad one.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Heavy black trash bags with blood on them in the back of matts truck
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,What would have the size and weight of body parts minus the cost.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:06 PM",No,Yeah that's bad lol
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:07 PM",Yes,Smear a little blood on his door handles
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:07 PM",Yes,Haha I know! What's wrong with me??
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:06 PM",No,And you didn't want to do fake blood on their porch?! Haha
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:06 PM",No,I don't know haha
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,Oh I'm all for the blood on the porch now. But if it's on the truck I know rain will wash it off.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,And/or car wash
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:12 PM",No,Yeah that's still pretty dark though lol
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:14 PM",Yes,Ok.. How about just garden trimmings; leaves and such.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:15 PM",No,Haha where would you get that?
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:16 PM",Yes,I could start taking the grounds at my apartment lol.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:16 PM",Yes,Wait.. We don't get leaves till the fall though...
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:16 PM",No,Hahaha and stashing them in your apartment?!
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:16 PM",No,We don't get leaves at all really. 
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,Omg!!! That reminds me! When I still lived with my parents I saved toilet paper rolls for several months. The. One night in the am I hid them all around the house.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:18 PM",Yes,If only I had access to his apartment..
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:18 PM",No,"How about baking a chocolate cake as a peace offering? Then cutting out the middle, filling it with paper towels, and covering the top again with chocolate icing?"
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:18 PM",Yes,So devious!
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:18 PM",No,We already talked about the whole access to the apartment thing though and you thought that would be creepy lol
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:19 PM",Yes,I know.. And it would. But I want to go all out. I could ice some weighted styrofoam.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,That might work pretty well.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,Or the dog biscuit cookies. O_O
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:21 PM",Yes,Or I could just bake something normal and then give them a horrible look when I hand it off to them.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:21 PM",Yes,Then they'll be afraid to eat it.
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:21 PM",Yes,And if they do eat it. They'll worry about getting sick.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:24 PM",No,That was the point of the chocolate cake haha
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,I thought you said stuff it with paper towels
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Yeah but we wouldn't have to haha
+17069923021,"May 13, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,The perfect crime.
+12103557887,"May 13, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Haha
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 8:57 PM",Yes,"So we're going to see Godzilla on Saturday night. Most likely the 920 showing. Kris, Rick, Reggie, Kelli, possibly Brandon. Want to go?"
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 8:58 PM",Yes,I know I mentioned going to see it tomorrow. But we all forgot to request off work haha.
+12103557887,"May 14, 2014 9:06 PM",No,"I wouldn't have been able to go tomorrow anyway after I thought about it, cause I still have work at 7 on Friday. And let me see what's going on for Saturday. My cousin is having a birthday party, so I don't know for sure what I'm doing on Saturday yet. When do you need to know by?"
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,Oops not Thursday. That was already plan B. Haha ignore that part. I would just need to know when we decide to get the tickets. We're gonna try to get them at the same time so we can all sit together. But I honestly don't know when that will be. Hopefully by Friday.
+12103557887,"May 14, 2014 11:10 PM",No,Okay. I'll let you know then. 
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,"no pressure, family's important. =)"
+12103557887,"May 14, 2014 11:28 PM",No,Yeah... We'll see lol
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,Haha what are you still doing up? Don't you have work? Ive been trying not to text you at late so you can sleep lol.
+12103557887,"May 14, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Haha I know I know. I was cleaning my bathroom but I am heading to bed 
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 11:32 PM",Yes,Cleaning your bathroom this late? Wow. I'm gonna be cleaning basically all day tomorrow. My apartment looks terrible... *ashamed face*
+17069923021,"May 14, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,Goodnight though. Look out for those ants!
+12103557887,"May 14, 2014 11:33 PM",No,Yeah my house is pretty bad too. Haha night!
+17069923021,"May 15, 2014 5:28 PM",Yes,Is this the type of vibrant green you were talking about your mom making? ￼
+17069923021,"May 15, 2014 5:29 PM",Yes,a.k.a. heaven? Haha
+12103557887,"May 15, 2014 5:32 PM",No,Yeah kinda. A little more of a forest green though. 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:28 PM",Yes,I felt bad cause Kris brought Jessica with him last night. And he got on my computer to play. And she just kinda sat there on the couch playing around with her phone. He kept asking her if she wanted to play but she said she didn't want to.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:28 PM",No,Hahaha oh you boys and your games
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:32 PM",Yes,"Well she plays games too. I think she just feels really awkward when he drags her over here. And hey! Video games are serious business, madam! Haha"
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:30 PM",No,Well I don't play them so I wouldn't know lol
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:37 PM",Yes,You seem like someone who would enjoy them though. Not hardcore ones though. More of the casual genres. That's ok though. Kris is a casual and I'm still friends with him haha. =P
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:38 PM",No,I just don't have the hand-eye coordination for it. Haha
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:41 PM",No,I've tried but I take too long to react to stuff and end up having to focus too hard to enjoy it. 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:43 PM",Yes,"Aw, well I wont force you into play anything haha. That's why board games are still around."
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:43 PM",Yes,I snagged matts broom last night.￼
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:43 PM",Yes,At least I'm pretty sure it's theirs.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:45 PM",No,Hahaha and what if it's not theirs? Lol
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:46 PM",Yes,I'm not quite sure. Hopefully the owner doesn't see it on my pros hand angrily bang on my door with the hopes of unleashing harsh words at me.
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:46 PM",Yes,*porch and
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:47 PM",No,Bwahahaha that would be hilarious though
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:48 PM",Yes,Not for me! lol Words hurt!
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:48 PM",No,I meant if it did belong to some random person it would be funny. 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:49 PM",Yes,Oh haha
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:49 PM",No,Getting yelled at isn't funny. 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:50 PM",Yes,"No it's not. However, I took a chair from the same back patio and put it in front of their door. So..."
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:50 PM",No,Hahaha well you're probably good then 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:53 PM",Yes,How's your day? Now that you're/you've nearing/reached the end of the work shift?
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:53 PM",No,It was alright. 
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:54 PM",No,Kinda ehhh
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 3:56 PM",Yes,Does alright = annoying? Or just uneventful.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 3:58 PM",No,Eventful but not in a good way. And then also I eventful at the same time. I dunno. It was a very off day. Definitely a Friday. 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:04 PM",Yes,im sorry. Days like that suck.
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:05 PM",Yes,Almost like wasted hours.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:05 PM",No,Yeah. Definitely wasted today 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:28 PM",Yes,Well at least it's now weekend time right? Are you looking forward to your cousins birthday?
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:30 PM",No,I'm not sure if I'm going to it yet. I have a friend's birthday party tonight. But I don't know if I want to drive all the way out to my Aunt's house for my cousin's party haha. They live like an hour away. And they're my step-dad's family so I'm not that close to them anyway. I'm waiting to see if my mom guilt trips me into going or not lol
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:34 PM",Yes,Ugh.. My mom does that a lot.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:32 PM",No,I think that's just what moms do 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:34 PM",Yes,"It's everyone's birthday. Reggie, crap. I think my brothers birthday is today O_O"
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:35 PM",Yes,Haha have you used the mystical power yet?
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:35 PM",No,Haha that's not good
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:35 PM",No,The what? Lol
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:35 PM",Yes,Th motherly guilt trip haha
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:36 PM",No,Oh haha no my kids aren't old enough to feel guilt yet 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:39 PM",Yes,I don't really have much of a way to contact my brother though. I usually just talk to him through my sister in law lol.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:43 PM",No,You can't call him? Hah
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:46 PM",Yes,as far as I know only she has a cell. I guess I could try calling her and asking for him. But his work schedule is pretty wonky.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:47 PM",No,Hahaha well you should at least try
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:47 PM",Yes,But I just learned it's the 22nd not today. Not sure how I got the 16th.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:47 PM",No,Oh geez lol
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:50 PM",Yes,"I feel like a terrible sibling, but this is the first year I don't have my mother constantly telling me their birthday is this Saturday, Tues, etc. I feel like a deserve a grace period."
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 4:51 PM",Yes,I do know my sisters birthday! =D
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 4:51 PM",No,Well that's good haha
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Oh boy.. This is why Matt told me I was dead... ￼
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Buahahaha so hilarious!
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,I had nothing to do with this.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:44 PM",No,Hahahahaha who did it?!
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:44 PM",No,Kris?
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,I have noooo idea. Haha
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,A vigilante!
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:46 PM",No,Seriously? That's crazy!
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:47 PM",No,Hahahahaha 
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:47 PM",No,A dark ninja?
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:48 PM",Yes,Kris never said anything to me.
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:48 PM",Yes,Darkwing Duck
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:48 PM",No,Hahahaha yes!
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:50 PM",Yes,Matt supposedly thinks I did it though. Haha.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:50 PM",No,Of course he does 
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,And I had never really thought of getting him while he was at work. So new warfare tactic. =)
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:51 PM",No,Hahaha nice
+17069923021,"May 16, 2014 8:57 PM",Yes,Well I never met up with anyone to get tickets today. So were just gonna meet up at the theatre tomorrow. If you manage to avoid your mom's guilt trip and want to go.
+12103557887,"May 16, 2014 8:57 PM",No,Haha I'll let you know in the morning what's going on with it. 
+12103557887,"May 17, 2014 2:16 PM",No,I don't think I'm gonna go I the movies tonight. But you all have fun without me!
+17069923021,"May 17, 2014 3:05 PM",Yes,=( Aww ok. 
+12103557887,"May 17, 2014 3:37 PM",No,"Yeah, sorry"
+17069923021,"May 17, 2014 6:44 PM",Yes,It's alright. =)
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 2:45 PM",Yes,Hey what's goin on?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 3:16 PM",No,Hey! Not much. Just working and trying to get rid of these allergy headaches. I'm thinking about breaking down and seeing a doctor finally. It takes a lot for me to get to that point too. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 4:41 PM",Yes,Aw you poor thing. If it's been bothering you that much then that was probably a good decision.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 4:42 PM",Yes,They finally stopped bothering me. I just got back from walk/running the Leon creek trail. First time out there. I didn't bring my phone or a watch. I ended up being out there for 2 and a half hours!
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 4:56 PM",No,Haha nice. Long walks often help to clear the head and heart. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 5:23 PM",Yes,That was my plan. Anxiety has had a pretty strong hold on me this last week. Although I spent a little longer than I was planning haha. Once I came back from the wilderness I went to target to get a camelback lol.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 5:24 PM",No,Why are you anxious?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 5:48 PM",Yes,Partially due to school. I've had been worried about one class in particular. Which I found out today I passed. *sigh of relief* And also since school has been out I've had all this time on my hands that I didn't know what to do with. Which was ok the first week because I hung out with you and Kris throughout the week. But after that it seemed like no one was really available to do anything. So I went from being busy all the time to... Ok now how do I pass the time lol.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 5:48 PM",Yes,And we still haven't seen Godzilla in case your interested in seeing that. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 5:50 PM",Yes,And being idle makes me anxious. Seems kinda odd to me.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 7:00 PM",No,Haha oh yeah I kinda get the same way. When I'm idle I just sleep a lot though. So maybe that's not a totally bad thing as I'm sure my brain needs the sleep. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 7:35 PM",Yes,During the day?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,I love The Producers. So great. Have you seen either or both of them?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:24 PM",No,I take naps haha. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",No,The musical? I saw the one with Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,Naps turn me into a grump haha. I wake up all hot and growly.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,That's the one I like the most.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,I like it more than the original.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Then you're napping wrong lol
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",No,I haven't seen the original. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,How do you nap wrong? Haha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:25 PM",No,I dunno. Naps are glorious. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,The original is good too. But it's not As good as the remake. It's got gene wilder in it.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:26 PM",No,Maybe you sleep too long?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:26 PM",No,Gotcha. Gene Wilder is crazy. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,Is there a suggested sleep time?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,I've never had an enjoyable nap.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Hmm... 30 minutes? 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,Unless it's at night.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:27 PM",No,If I'm too tired my naps can get long though. But anything over an hour and a half shouldn't count as a nap in my opinion. At that point it's just sleeping. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Wait wait wait. I thought the definition of a nap is if it's during the day and under 4 hours.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:30 PM",Yes,The dictionary isn't specific enough.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Hahaha I'm going off of my own definition lol
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,Ok so less than 1.5 hours. Does that count at night too?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",No,If my nap lasts longer than 2 hours I stay sleepy and get grumpy too though. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",No,No. Not at night. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Just dayside. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:31 PM",No,And why would you not want to sleep longer than that at night? 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,My skin gets all dry too. Like suddenly all the liquid in my body just vanishes. Maybe I'm teleporting in my sleep and leaving all my liquids behind.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,"Well what if you need to get up early for a flight, but you stayed up all night packing? And only got 1.25 hours of sleep?"
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,I would consider that sleeping right?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,Even though it's short.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:35 PM",No,"I don't think it technically counts as sleep unless it's more than four hours because that's how long a REM cycle takes to complete. But if it's at night, then culturally we still call it ""sleeping"" and not ""napping"". But 1.25 hours should be considered a nap in my opinion. "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,I want to write a book that defines the rulings for things like this.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Hahaha and what would you call it? 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:39 PM",Yes,The Least Helpful Handbook for Life
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:39 PM",Yes,Maybe on instead of for
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:38 PM",No,Hahahahaha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:38 PM",No,Then why would people buy it if it's the LEAST helpful?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,...That You Should Still Buy
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,...Even Though It Isn't All That Helpful
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:40 PM",No,"How about ""All of the Real Answers to Life's Ubiquitous Questions You Never Thought You Needed to Know But Still Do Need to Know"""
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,The title print just keeps getting smaller and smaller till it's no longer visible to the naked eye
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,Ok Iove it
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Wow
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,I'll just let you come up with all my titles from now on.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:43 PM",No,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:43 PM",No,I'll try my best
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:44 PM",Yes,"There was something I started writing in highschool that I wanted to title ""The Manbook Handbook: All the Unwritten Rules of Being A Man Written Down"""
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:45 PM",Yes,I didn't get that far. Haha I'd love to go back and try again.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:47 PM",No,"I'd remove the ""Written Down"" and replace that with ""Written in Easy to Digest Man-Size Pieces"""
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:47 PM",No,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:48 PM",No,Not to correct you or anything...
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:49 PM",Yes,Haha no that's funny.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:50 PM",Yes,I need to take another look at that Jim Belushi book. I think he might have beat me too my idea
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,Be it with more vulgar content hha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:50 PM",No,"There are probably several like that, but a comedy book is a comedy book and will always be slightly different as it's told from someone else's  perspective. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:53 PM",No,Kinda random... But if I find one of my cat's whiskers lying around (they shed whiskers too) I'll pick it up and stick it on the top of his head so he looks like a feline Alfalfa. Hahahaha. It's relevant because I jut found a whisker and he now looks like Alfalfa. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:53 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:53 PM",No,*just
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:53 PM",Yes,I think my neighbors just questioned my sanity.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",No,It doesn't last long though because it probably pokes him and he can feel it's there. So he starts cleaning his head off. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",No,Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,I don't remember my cat ever losing whisker. At least I never found any.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",No,Did you laugh that hard?
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,I did.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,10/10 was not expecting
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:54 PM",No,"My cat is only ever on my bed, so I find whiskers there every once in a while. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:55 PM",No,Yeah. I forewarned you though. It was random. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 8:56 PM",Yes,Cats are the best. One of the few animals I get along with well.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:57 PM",No,My cats always have relatively canine-like personalities. In a way. It's weird. They're more needy than most cats. They chase their tails. They lick me if they want food or treats. They get hyper when people come home. I dunno why. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:58 PM",No,I had one cat that spoke when you told it to. And my current cat will sit on command. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 8:58 PM",No,Very strange. They still sleep all the time though. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,I love cats that lick. I've heard people say cat tongues are disgusting but I love them. What drives me nuts are licky dogs lol.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,"I have this sort of fanciful backstory amongst friends of how I became and am part cat. (Kinda like Spider-Man) it explains my reflexes, graceful movements, and the reason I haven't died yet(got 7 lives left)"
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,My your leader used to call me catman haha
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,*youth
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:03 PM",No,"Yeah one of my dogs is way too licky. I hate feeling wet and slobbery though so it pisses me off. I know he's just trying to love on me but it makes me not want to touch him at all. And I don't care for the roughness of cat's tongues all the time. One or two licks I can handle, but any more than that gives me the willies. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:03 PM",No,Catman? Hahahaha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:03 PM",No,Oh geez
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,It is gross.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,I had a bird for quite a while. He was fun. He would clean my ears haha. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:07 PM",Yes,Although I keep my ears pretty clean in the first place.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:07 PM",No,I don't know how I would feel about that haha
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:07 PM",Yes,Haha it tickled! 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:08 PM",No,"Yeah it probably did, but I probably wouldn't enjoy that kind of tickling. "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:08 PM",Yes,"Of course now that I think about it, if he was actually eating stuff from my ears that's kinda revolting lol."
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:08 PM",No,I don't care much do tickling anyway. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:08 PM",No,*for
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:08 PM",No,"Yeah, that is kinda gross... 😐"
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,What? no tickling? *gasp*
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,"I used to get tickled a lot then I figured out how to ""turn it off"" and I would just do that when people started."
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:12 PM",Yes,Unless they took me fully by surprise. Then it was harder.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:13 PM",Yes,So you don't have tickle fights with your kids?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:13 PM",No,"I kinda got ruined as a kid. My cousins and sisters would sit on me and tickle me to the point where I would have panic attacks and start crying. It makes me feel really uncomfortable. When my ex would try to tickle me I felt like I was being pinned down into a dark nasty place that I couldn't escape and I would start weeping uncontrollably. He learned pretty quickly that I didn't like being tickled, so he would sit on me and tickle me when he wanted to make me feel uncomfortable. It was kind of horrible. Not to be a downer or anything. But yeah, I'm not a big fan of tickling. At. All. "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:14 PM",Yes,Wow that sucks.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:14 PM",No,"I'll tickle them for a few seconds, but mostly just to make them giggle and then grab them into a big bear hug and cuddle for a bit. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:15 PM",No,Yeah. It sucks... My daughter is the same way though. She starts crying if you tickle her too long. 
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:16 PM",No,Sorry. That got deep. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:18 PM",Yes,That's ok. =) now I know not to ever attempt to tickle you. We all have stuff that we absolutely cannot tolerate. And often times it can have a sad or dark backstory.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:19 PM",No,Sometimes I forget stuff like that is still hidden deep in the caverns of my memories and it's not easy to face when it comes flying out. I've realized that I compartmentalize way more than most people. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,"I think it can be good though. I know I have things I've done and experienced in my last that aren't pleasant. Occasionally I'll remember one. ""Oh yeah, I did that."" Or ""That actually did happen didn't it."" I'm just glad I'm at the point where things like that don't continually haunt me."
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:22 PM",Yes,*good to compartmentalize 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:22 PM",Yes,Sometimes
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:25 PM",No,"Yeah. My memories don't  haunt me per say. But when they pop out like that, so candidly, it makes me realize that I probably don't face them well enough in the first place, so my version of compartmentalizing is really just hiding it until it gets too stinky or smelly and can't be ignored anymore and then it'll just pop out when I'm not expecting it to and it comes as a shock to me. Which may be even harder to handle in the end. I'm kinda crying right now haha "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:25 PM",Yes,=( I'm so sorry. I'll share one since you told me about your tickling history.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:26 PM",No,I don't say that to make you feel bad. It just came out. I don't always have a filter. Which can make people uncomfortable I guess. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:33 PM",Yes,"I just feel like your being open. It's not bad. And i don't feel uncomfortable when you share things like that. It actually makes me feel safe. Like I can trust you. I think I might have mentioned to you that my biggest fear is not being believed because I would get accused of things as a kid that I didn't actually do. But my parents wouldn't believe me because I was ""just a kid"". Well it wasn't just being accused of things. My brother would do things to scare me. One time in particular he woke me up in the middle of the night. He was standing at my door with a giant knife in his hand. He then proceeded to chase me all over the house with this knife. I was almost certain he was trying to kill me. My dad wasn't home but I ran into my moms room and she was taking a bath. She told me she didn't believe me and told me I has just having a nightmare. Stuff like this would happen all the time but my brother would never catch any blame for it. It was just the kid with the active imagination. To this day I hate movies when the character is falsely put into an insane asylum. I can't watch them. They just make me angry."
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:33 PM",Yes,That was long sorry.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,I've since worked things out with my brother. But the scars are still there.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:37 PM",No,"That's not cool. Siblings aren't always the nicest people. Mine were okay till they became teenagers. And even though I was the oldest, they still did some stuff that wasn't cool. I don't think I ever did anything to them at all. At least not purposefully. It would be interesting to see if they feel differently. Like if they feel that I did something to them that i don't remember because it don't affect me in the same way. But in your case, I'm sure your brother remembers doing that. That's not cool at all. I'm sorry. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:37 PM",No,*didn't affect 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,"Hey, stuff happens right? The kind of ironic thing is the fact that I attribute my learning the importance of apologies to my brother. And not because of incidents like this."
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,Because of an entirely different non negative situation.
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:43 PM",Yes,So.. Anything comical happen to you today? Haha things kinda got serious right there.
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 9:49 PM",No,"Naw today was immensely non-comical. It wasn't really serious until just now, but it wasn't full of giggles either. I didn't sleep well all weekend and therefore wasn't feeling too great at work so today dragged on and on. The headache didn't help at all. I had a pretty serious conversation with my sister before I had to get the kids from their dad. And then they came home smelling like they had been doused in patchouli, which was probably deliberate because their dad knows I get headaches from that scent. So then I felt sick to my stomach too. So, no, nothing funny happened really. Except for the Alfalfa cat thing. Haha maybe I'm just grumpy as well. "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:53 PM",Yes,"Man, you had it rough today. I Had to look that herb up. Is that commonly used in stuff?"
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,When are you going to the doctor?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 10:41 PM",No,"Patchouli? It's used as a scent to hide the smell of marijuana mostly. It's that strong. You smell it in head shops and on hippies all the time. And it's commonly used in incense. I just can't handle it though. I swear he used to burn it on purpose when he wanted to make me feel sick or just be mean. He would always act like he forgot that the smell gave me problems, but I'm sorry, if you're with someone for that long and you love them, you don't forget the things that give them problems. Especially when the headaches were so debilitating that I could wind up in bed for half a day or more. "
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 10:43 PM",No,And I don't know about the doctor. I might try to go this week or next. My doctor only sees patients on Thursdays. Haha
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 10:44 PM",No,"But he's a naturopathic doctor. Not a normal, shots and pills, kinda guy. "
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 10:47 PM",Yes,lol Thursdays only for everybody?
+12103557887,"May 19, 2014 10:48 PM",No,Haha yeah. He works out of Boerne so his client base is pretty small. Very cool guy though. 
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 11:08 PM",Yes,Sorry mom mom ended up calling me back from earlier today. I don't want to keep you up cause I know you have work. But I wanted to wish you a restful night! Goodnight!
+17069923021,"May 19, 2014 11:08 PM",Yes,*my mom
+17069923021,"May 20, 2014 8:58 PM",Yes,Does he do anything else? Or is that is sole profession.
+17069923021,"May 20, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,It would seem hard to me to make a living off of a Thursday only client base
+12103557887,"May 20, 2014 9:39 PM",No,"He's also a welder. He doesn't charge anything for it really. He feels that God has called him to help people through naturopathic healing, so that's his personal ministry of sorts. "
+12103557887,"May 20, 2014 9:39 PM",No,"But he is good friends with my parents, so my whole family sees him when we can. "
+17069923021,"May 20, 2014 10:03 PM",Yes,That's pretty cool.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 12:50 PM",Yes,So what does an ND actually do?
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 1:51 PM",No,They do a muscle test and then recommend herbal supplements and oils to treat whatever you've got going on. It's pretty cool.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:42 PM",Yes,"While at work, this little girl kept saying hi to people that were passing her. When I walked by she started saying hi over and over. And I did my slightly awkward, elongated ""hellooooo"". So then afterwards a he starts going ""Helloooo! Helloooooo! Hellooooo!"" to other guests as I walked away. So cute."
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:43 PM",No,How old was she?
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:43 PM",Yes,Maybe like 5?
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:43 PM",Yes,Possibly 4
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:44 PM",No,Cute
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:46 PM",No,My kids were never like that.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:46 PM",Yes,Did you want to see Godzilla or Xmen? Our little group still didn't make it to the theatre for Godzilla.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:47 PM",Yes,Do you mean they're more quiet and reserved?
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:47 PM",No,When? I have the kids this weekend and we're going to Dallas.
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:47 PM",No,Yes. Definitely. They take after me in that respect.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,Ooh exciting! I don't have a specific time. I just wanted to know of you wanted to see either of them. I couldn't tell if you didn't want to go last time because of the movie choice or you weren't feeling well or whatnot.
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 7:52 PM",No,Haha I wasn't super excited about it lol. But I also wasn't feeling well. I've had a pretty stressful couple of days. I'd be down to see X-Men though.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:54 PM",Yes,I was always a very literal kid. My mother once told me during breakfast I would pop if I ate one more pancake. I started crying. I guess that's why sarcasm and facetious statements often elude me as an adult.
+17069923021,"May 21, 2014 7:55 PM",Yes,Also cool. I'll definitely keep you in mind for xmen. Haha you can tell me if you're not into a movie or other stuff. 
+12103557887,"May 21, 2014 10:09 PM",No,"Hahaha fair enough. I'll make sure to be straight forward with that stuff then. Haha. Well, I'm heading to bed. Have a good night."
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 12:30 AM",Yes,Thanks you too. Lookout for ants. =P
,"May 22, 2014 3:17 PM",Yes,I found another bus lot on my trek.￼
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 4:09 PM",No,Where's that?
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 4:09 PM",No,"If it's near you, that's probably not my district."
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 4:10 PM",No,It would be Northside ISD.
,"May 22, 2014 4:51 PM",Yes,I'm pretty sure it is north side. I was out on the Leon Creek trail.
,"May 22, 2014 4:52 PM",Yes,Hey did you change your phone? iMessages doesn't work anymore when I text you. o_O
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",No,I don't know what's going on with my phone actually. 
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",No,But I just reset the network settings. 
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",No,So I guess that fixed it. 
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",No,Haha
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",Yes,Hey! It's back!
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:03 PM",No,Sometimes I can fix things I guess. 
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 5:04 PM",Yes,You are smart.
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 5:04 PM",Yes,I saw some deer today too. Not just wild busses
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 5:05 PM",Yes,Oh next Thursday many of us are off. Would you want to see xmen then?
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:06 PM",No,That could probably work for me. 
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 5:06 PM",No,As long as it's not too late though. Haha I've got old-lady grown-up job in the morning. 
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 5:08 PM",Yes,Haha yeah I don't think we would be going late.

+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 9:15 PM",Yes,No it was really tight on Brandon. I don't think i could wear it on my huge head lol.
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 9:31 PM",No,Your head is bigger than Brandon's? Hahahaha that's a surprise. His is pretty round. Maybe it's your hair that gets in the way. 
+17069923021,"May 22, 2014 9:36 PM",Yes,I don't know. I feel like I have a fairly big head. Maybe it is just the hair lol.
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,Hahaha yeah I dunno
+12103557887,"May 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,Maybe

+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:21 PM",Yes,So who is you favourite of the xmen universe?
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:22 PM",Yes,Doesn't have to be based on the characters personality. Could be solely based on they're ability.
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:22 PM",No,Hmmmmm probably Charles Xavier. Or the Beast. 
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,Oh come on. Xavier's kind of a cheap shot. Jk. But the beast I'm curious about. why is that?
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Brains over brawn right? With both of them. 
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,Yeah ok. I actually don't know very much about beast.
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:29 PM",No,"Why is the Professor a cheap shot? If he's awesome, then he's awesome hahaha. "
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,Haha because he's so awesome!
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:31 PM",No,And the Beast is super genius smart. 
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Plus he's blue. 
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Even better. 
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,I bet he gets that joke a lot...
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:32 PM",Yes,Are you feeling a little blue today?

+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,I prefer my light waves to be a bit longer
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:33 PM",No,There's no convincing me otherwise. 
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,I won't try.
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:35 PM",No,Hahaha you would make it all scientific wouldn't you? 
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,Haha I thought about it. *starts thinking of ways to prove green is a better color*
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,But I can't
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,It's not possible. You're simply too dedicated to blue. =)
+17069923021,"May 27, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,I lean more towards Jean or Pyro.
+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:55 PM",No,"Blue is my childhood. \LFWater, waves, rain, air, clouds, breeze, and cold. \LFIt is the pop of electric on a butterfly, the peep of a bluejay against the trees, the soft petals of a hydrangea, forget-me-not, or a sweet pea flower. \LFIt is the undulating shimmer of a fish, the hard ridges of a sea shell, and the smooth fingers of a sea anemone deep in tidal pools surrounded by midnight blue rocks. \LFIt is the smell of clean, crisp, invigorating. \LFIt is the color of the morning sky as the sun takes over the moon, and the color of the evening and night sky as the moon hangs in its place again. \LFIt is the color of the blood which courses through my veins and which flows through the bodies of my children. \LFIt is the color of the eyes I inherited from both of my parents, whose faces were the first I saw, the first I loved, and whose blue eyes have shed crystal tears of both joy and sadness on my behalf. \LFIt is the color of the water that renews me and of the air which envelops me. \LFIt is the still of the night and the excitement of the day. \LFIt is the calm and understanding, the free-spirited and adventurous, the contemplative and thought-provoking, the nurturing and caring, all the parts of me. \LFBlue is my lifeblood, my memories, my dreams, my past, present, and future. \LFIt is the color of the unknown which will one day call me home to Him, and in it I will find rest.

+12103557887,"May 27, 2014 8:56 PM",No,"And, after that heaviness... Both of your choices are red and fiery. So, your pyromaniac tendencies have clearly not dwindled over the years. Haha"
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:21 PM",Yes,"Jessie, that was really beautiful."
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:21 PM",Yes,Really... Did you write that last night? Off the top of your head?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:24 PM",No,"Haha yeah, I wrote it in the fifteen minutes between your text and my response lol"
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:25 PM",No,Free form poetry I guess. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,"And regards to the powers. Although I do still love fire. The reason behind my interest in Jean and Pyro is their ability to manipulate things. One of the greatest feelings in the world for me is when something becomes an ""extension of my body."" Which is why I love driving, I love juggling, I love balancing things, martial arts, spinning poi. Just interacting with things on a physical level is fun for me. The point where it becomes muscle memory is such a great feeling. So being able to do something like Jean and pyro has an entirely new medium for interacting with the world around me. =)"
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,Well I really enjoyed reading it.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:30 PM",No,So you like manipulating things huh? Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,I wanted to respond earlier but I figured you were in bed. I was worried that I might wake you up. Do you set your phone completely on silent at night?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",No,"Well, thanks for liking it. "
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",Yes,Using physics
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",No,Sometimes I silence my phone. But if I get a message it won't wake me up completely. 
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",No,I was teasing lol
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",Yes,Maybe that's a better way to say it. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:31 PM",No,I understood.

+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:33 PM",No,Haha no I never saw that 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:34 PM",Yes,Wake you up completely? I don't want to disturb your slumber period lol.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:33 PM",No,Hahaha well I was only saying
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:55 PM",Yes,Do you ever write poems into a book of some sort?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 1:58 PM",No,"No. I used to journal and would write poems pretty often. But I always felt like a pretentious know-it-all when I re-read them and wouldn't do anything with them. They never seemed important, just self-indulgent. And I'm not very self-centered so it felt weird. Haha, I dunno..."
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 1:59 PM",Yes,Why did you feel like that? Was it the topics? wording?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:00 PM",No,"Wording I guess. I suppose I just felt like people would think I was ""talking above them"" and I didn't want to seem like a snob. "
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:01 PM",No,"I like using big flowery words sometimes, which I guess can make people feel like I'm stuck-up. "
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:01 PM",Yes,Yeah...
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:02 PM",Yes,People who can't appreciate the art of language
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:02 PM",No,And there are a lot of those kinds of people 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:02 PM",Yes,I get excited when I have to look something up. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:02 PM",Yes,Sadly yeah
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:03 PM",No,I love language. That's why Tolkien is my favorite author. 
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:03 PM",No,But his genius is often lost in the subject of his works. There's so much meaty goodness in his prose that a lot of people miss out on. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:10 PM",Yes,"It's hard when you're so deep in understanding of your passion to where it makes it difficult to share with others. Literature nerds, computer nerds, and philosophers is where I've noticed It the most."
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:11 PM",Yes,Oh and people into classical mythology
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 2:12 PM",Yes,Math too... The intense kind
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 2:12 PM",No,Yeah but even people within those same fields and with the same passions often have difficulty sharing with their peers. It's a confusing world in academia. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 3:14 PM",Yes,What I do love is being able to super obscure dorky jokes amongst peers in a specific field. I took a steganography course last summer. And almost every class our professor would come in and tell us another CS joke. Occasionally he would tell one that only a sprinkle of us would understand. Those were good.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 4:21 PM",Yes,But I don't really have any programming friends. So I don't get to do that a lot.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,Are you still up for Xmen tomorrow?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:29 PM",No,Sorry. I've been hashing out some pretty heavy stuff with my mom for several hours. What time are you going?
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:46 PM",Yes,I'm going to head over there just before 8. And see what options there are following 8. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:46 PM",Yes,What showings there are during 8.. Well I you get what I'm tryin to say lol.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:47 PM",Yes,I cant communicate today I have the dumb.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:47 PM",No,What times there are after eight?
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:48 PM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,815 an 845. But I think there are some IMAX or whatever type showing littered in there too.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:48 PM",No,You'd want to do IMAX? 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:49 PM",Yes,It doesn't really matter to me. 915. 1020 also. But I know you have your big girl job so I don't want to keep you out too late lol.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:50 PM",No,Haha yeah earlier is probably better. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:54 PM",Yes,Okey!
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:54 PM",Yes,I need to get like a 1lb back of sour patch kids.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,I can stuff them in my shirt to smuggle 'em in.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:54 PM",No,Or you could put them in my purse...
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,Well... Yeah I guess that would work too.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:54 PM",No,Yeah it could
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:56 PM",Yes,It wouldn't be nearly as fun though haha.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:56 PM",No,Haha I guess
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:57 PM",Yes,lol
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 9:58 PM",Yes,Line a trench coat with candy.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 9:58 PM",No,And then eat the lint covered pieces. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,That's... I mean.. It would be in bags haha.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,It's not like I would have tummies hanging from Christmas tree decor hooks.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,*gummies
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:05 PM",No,"Hahaha you said ""line a trench coat with candy"" not BAGS of candy. "
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:05 PM",No,So I pictured a candy-lined suit. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,I'm not Wonka!
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:07 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:05 PM",No,Well...candy-lines suit? That's pretty close to me. 
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Linty candy isn't that bad though. So even if it was bagless.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Unless it's wet linty candy
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:09 PM",Yes,The. That's kinda gross
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:09 PM",Yes,And not in the cumulative way.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:09 PM",No,Yeah...it would still be gross Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:11 PM",Yes,Not a fan of he fuzzy candies?
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:11 PM",Yes,*the
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:12 PM",No,"Haha yeah, not so much. I'm not a fan of picking lint out of my mouth haha"
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:13 PM",Yes,Ooh ooh
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:14 PM",Yes,Business idea. Candy that is fuzzy.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:14 PM",Yes,But edible fizz
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:15 PM",Yes,Like a hard candy that you suck on. And it has hairs that don't dissolve right away.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:16 PM",No,Sooooo....cotton candy?
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:24 PM",Yes,Well I mean like hairlike. Like imagine a jolly rancher with flagellum.
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:24 PM",No,Flagellum doesn't sound appetizing hahaha
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:24 PM",No,Too close to flatulence. 
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:24 PM",No,Bwahahaha
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:26 PM",Yes,Ew.. That's the appeal though. The oddness of the candy. Ok we'll advertise it as tentacles instead.
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:27 PM",Yes,Just super skinny tentacles
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:26 PM",No,Tentaculous delight?
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:29 PM",Yes,Oh my
+17069923021,"May 28, 2014 10:31 PM",Yes,Is there a way to mix tantalus into that word as well? Haha
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:31 PM",No,Uhhmmmm
+12103557887,"May 28, 2014 10:32 PM",No,Maaaaaybeee

+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:19 PM",No,Okay. I'm running an errand but I should be able to meet you then. 
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 7:20 PM",Yes,Okey

+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:21 PM",No,He makes me uncomfortable. 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:21 PM",No,Like a squidgy feeling. 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:21 PM",No,I dunno. 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:22 PM",No,Just saying. 
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 7:25 PM",Yes,Well you can sit faaaar away from him. I'm not really sure what to do. He's usually the one instigating the movie runs. What bothers you about him? Other than the fact that he gives off a bit of a creepy vibe. 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:33 PM",No,Stuff I probably can't talk to you about haha 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:35 PM",No,I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable with the situation. I spoke without a filter. Sorry. 
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 7:52 PM",Yes,I'm sorry. I knew to felt weird around him but I wasn't aware of any privileged information. I'm not uncomfortable. I just feel kinda bad cause I put you into a situation your not comfortable with.

+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:51 PM",No,It's okay. I was just saying it. It won't kill me. 
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,Ive been downstairs waiting for him. He's not answering his phone or his texts now. I am litterally about to run out of gas haha.
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 7:57 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:57 PM",No,Then leave him. 
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 7:58 PM",No,Not because I don't want him to come. But there's no point in staying there and letting your car die. 
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,He called me back while I was at the gate. I forgot I offered to look at his computer. He's bringing it out to the car.
+17069923021,"May 29, 2014 8:02 PM",Yes,I'm a sucker for messing with computers.
+12103557887,"May 29, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Oh geez.

+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 2:53 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,Something I saw today while watching snack/baking videos was cake balls that were covered in caramel used sugar.

+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,And I have a question maybe you can help me with regarding handling compliments haha.

+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:08 PM",No,Hahahaha no it was in reference to needing my help with compliments. 
+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:09 PM",Yes,"Sometimes when women compliment my hair they say they with theirs looked as good as mine. And I feel like they are dissing they're hair. Am I supposed to just say thank you? Or do I say, ""oh don't even, your hair I lovely."""
+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:08 PM",No,Compliments such as...?

+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,That's all? It makes me feel weird.
+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,"Almost like my silence is saying, ""yeah girl yo hair so trashy."""
+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 8:13 PM",Yes,Emphasis on the sassy black lady from Columbus
+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:14 PM",No,No because if you say their hair is nice they might think you're being disingenuous. 
+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:14 PM",No,Just take the easy way out and say thanks 
+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:15 PM",No,Girls don't fish for compliments that way
+12103557887,"May 30, 2014 8:16 PM",No,"If they want to know what you think about their hair, they'll ask "
+17069923021,"May 30, 2014 10:12 PM",Yes,Oh I was thinking about favorite xmen powers again after seeing the movie. I'm really feeling Quicksilver now. Think of all the books you could read. You could learn so much. And still have free time.
+17069923021,"Jun 1, 2014 1:49 PM",Yes,"Do Caeden, Kailani, or your mom have any cookie preferences? "
+12103557887,"Jun 1, 2014 5:53 PM",No,They'd pretty much go for the chocolate chip variety and that's about it. Haha 
+17069923021,"Jun 1, 2014 6:20 PM",Yes,Well in all honesty it is the perfect cookie. All other cookies are inferior.
+17069923021,"Jun 1, 2014 6:21 PM",Yes,Whoever decided to put those ingredients together in the first place must have been an angel sent from heaven to deliver deliciousness.
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 4:25 PM",Yes,Would it be ok to bring cookies to you at work this week? And would you be interested in lunch as well? I'm planning on spending all day Wednesday baking.
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 4:40 PM",No,Haha. Yeah that would be fine. You don't have to bring me anything though lol
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,I know I don't have to lol. I want to. Would Thursday work for you? Is there anything you've been craving?
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:22 PM",No,Thursday should work. I'll check my calendar tomorrow just to make sure I don't have any meetings though. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:23 PM",No,And as far as cravings go..... Not really hahaha. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:23 PM",No,A good pasta is always fine with me. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:23 PM",No,I'm pretty simple. 
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,We had pasta last time lol. Wouldn't it be lame if I brought it again?
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:24 PM",No,Hahaha I haven't really had pasta since 
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,Ok lol. I do love pasta.
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Yeah I know lol
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,"No beef, pork, kangaroo, or shellfish right?"
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Haha that is correct sir 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,"If it's white, I'll be alright. Lol"
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,As far as meat goes anyway...
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,That was corny. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,And slightly bordering on racist. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,I feel ashamed. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,I could've done better. 
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Lol
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:30 PM",Yes,"I was confused at first because I read your texts backwards. That sounded like accidental ""could be taken as racist but wasn't actually"". Which I think is safe."
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Yeah the racism was not on purpose at all
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 8:39 PM",Yes,"I'm actually kinda jealous at the fact that bland white people, such as myself, have like no racial stereotypes. I would joke about them all the time if I did. =("
+12103557887,"Jun 2, 2014 8:43 PM",No,We have tons of racial stereotypes I'm sure. 
+17069923021,"Jun 2, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,Other than redneck ones?
+12103557887,"Jun 3, 2014 11:29 AM",No,Maybe just mostly redneck ones. But I'm sure there's more. 
+17069923021,"Jun 3, 2014 1:45 PM",Yes,I have a Australian friend and I asked home what stereotypes he had about Americans and he basically described to me the stereotypical Alabama redneck haha.
+12103557887,"Jun 3, 2014 1:44 PM",No,Hahaha well there you go. 
+17069923021,"Jun 3, 2014 8:00 PM",Yes,"I just walked around a corner into a couple's conversation, ""...feels like cuddling with chili."""
+12103557887,"Jun 3, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Uhhhhhh that's weird haha
+17069923021,"Jun 3, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,I was trying really hard not to laugh.
+12103557887,"Jun 3, 2014 8:01 PM",No,I can see why hahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 10:01 AM",Yes,Are we still good for lunch today?
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:02 AM",No,"Yeah. If you don't mind coming to my work on ""Spurs Day"" Hahahaha "
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:03 AM",No,We're all wearing Spurs shirts and jeans. My coworker brought me one since I don't have one of my own. 
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 10:11 AM",Yes,"Haha, am I going to be attacked for not having a spurs shirt?"
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:10 AM",No,Haha no
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:13 AM",No,"It's just funny because we got a district-wide memo from the Superintendent saying it was ""highly encouraged"" we all wear Spurs shirts and jeans to support ""our team"". Hahaha"
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:13 AM",No,"Everyone got all excited and I was like ""are the Spurs playing tomorrow?"""
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 10:16 AM",Yes,lol. To bad I don't have a Miami Heat shirt! Haha
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:15 AM",No,Yeaaaah.....
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:15 AM",No,Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 10:15 AM",No,That wouldn't be good for you 
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 11:25 AM",Yes,I'll be there between 1230-1. =:D if that's ok.
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 11:26 AM",No,That's fine. I just found out I have to be at the district office at 2 to pick something up real fast but that's only 5 minutes away. 
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 3:36 PM",No,Thanks again for lunch! It was good to see you again and the cookies were/are awesome!
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 5:10 PM",Yes,Thank you. It was totally my pleasure. Sorry about staying so long. It's so hard to leave. I didn't want to interrupt any of our discussions/stories. Don't get sick eating all those cookies at once haha. ;D
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:13 PM",No,You didn't stay too long. I didn't have much else to do anyway haha
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:13 PM",No,"And the cookies will last a bit. I don't know how long, but at least a day. "
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 5:16 PM",Yes,Oh yeah. I didn't really think about that. I usually freeze my cookies and eat them frozen.
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:17 PM",No,"No, haha, I meant the kids and I will go through them pretty fast, but not in one sitting lol. "
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:17 PM",No,They won't go BAD quickly
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:17 PM",No,They'll get eaten 
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 5:21 PM",Yes,Oh haha.
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 5:21 PM",Yes,I thought maybe you had little faith in the shelf stability of my cookies.
+17069923021,"Jun 5, 2014 5:22 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Jun 5, 2014 5:21 PM",No,Hahaha no not at all
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:06 PM",Yes,Wow what a week! How is your weekend going?
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:07 PM",No,You had a crazy week? Haha mine was pretty normal. The weekend has been full of vegging out on old cartoons and movies with the kids. 
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:13 PM",Yes,Cartoons! What are you watching? I'm making a point to watch at least two movies I've never seen before each week. I watched the shining last night. =D
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:14 PM",Yes,I just had a week full of fun things; friday especially. I explored a quarry with my friend Andrew. We were out there from 3 to sundown.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:14 PM",No,We're watching Atlantis. Netflix just added a bunch of Disney cartoons. 
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:15 PM",Yes,I loved that one. Haven't seen it in forever.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:15 PM",No,We watched the Sword in the Stone earlier. 
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:16 PM",Yes,I don't think I've seen that one all the way through.
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:16 PM",Yes,We never owned it. It was always one of hose movies I half watched at a friends house.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:16 PM",No,It's one of my favs. But I'm a big King Arthur geek. 
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:16 PM",No,It's on Netflix now. I'd take an hour to watch it. 
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:18 PM",Yes,I think that's what I'll watch once I settle down after laundry.
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:19 PM",Yes,I have to run out and get some fish filters too.
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 2:20 PM",Yes,And I'll make a ginormagantic bowl of popcorn.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 2:20 PM",No,That sounds like a lot of popcorn haha
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:23 PM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:24 PM",Yes,This is much healthier than that mistake during Caltain America.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 9:33 PM",No,Hahahaha yeah that was kind of epic 
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:35 PM",Yes,"I'm afraid to even look what the ingredients are in the ""butter flavoring"" they have at the theatre lol. I like my salt and pepper just fine."
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 9:47 PM",No,"Well, according to Jimmy Kimmel's mean tweets, it's John Goodman's ""ball sweat"". Hahahaha"
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,Oh my...
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:49 PM",Yes,Well he has moderately tasty ball sweat then.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 9:49 PM",No,Uhhhhh Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:49 PM",Yes,I'm no doctor but I would advise him to cut down on his sodium intake.
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 9:49 PM",Yes,Hey! You brought it up haha
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 9:50 PM",No,"Yeah, well I guess I did "
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,I miss this style of animation.
+17069923021,"Jun 8, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,If giving me a case of The Feels.
+12103557887,"Jun 8, 2014 10:07 PM",No,Yeah. It's a good style 
+17069923021,"Jun 9, 2014 6:39 PM",Yes,￼

+17069923021,"Jun 10, 2014 4:25 PM",Yes,In actually boarding for Hartford right now.
+12103557887,"Jun 10, 2014 4:26 PM",No,Nice! Have a safe flight! And I'll have to see what is going on with the family and let you know. Is that okay?
+12103557887,"Jun 10, 2014 4:26 PM",No,We're kind of playing it by ear still. 
+17069923021,"Jun 10, 2014 4:33 PM",Yes,Of course that's ok. =D I also don't want to steal your family time. When are You flying out on Thursday?
+12103557887,"Jun 10, 2014 4:32 PM",No,My plane leaves SA the 12th at 8:15pm and I fly back to SA on the 20th at 6:05am.  
+17069923021,"Jun 10, 2014 4:40 PM",Yes,"Wow that's late for a flight. Well we're about to take off so I need to shut down my ""devices"". Have a fun week!"
+12103557887,"Jun 10, 2014 4:40 PM",No,You too! 
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:01 PM",Yes,Have a safe flight Jessie! =D
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:13 PM",No,Thanks! Glad you made it there safely!
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:27 PM",Yes,Thanks. It's been an interesting trip. It took us 8 hours to drive a 4.5 hour stretch.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:27 PM",No,Yikes. Where to?
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:27 PM",Yes,We drove to Burlington Vermont from Hartford CT
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:29 PM",Yes,I was supposed to be navigating. But somehow we ended up on the wrong interstate.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:29 PM",No,Why did it take so long? Oh hahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:29 PM",Yes,And I assumed we were on the correct one. And I just kept waiting for our exit.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:32 PM",No,Hahahaha nice
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:32 PM",Yes,Do you have any weird layovers?
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:32 PM",No,"I'm in Phoenix for an hour or so. But it looks like that flight is being delayed an additional hour, so we'll see. But Phoenix is a nice airport so I don't mind. "
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:34 PM",Yes,It is. I was there last time in my way to Seattle. I had a really nasty sandwich from a Starbucks there though.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:34 PM",Yes,But that doesn't reflect badly in the airport haha.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:35 PM",Yes,I think that's the airport that I did like 4 laps throughout the Concorde.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:35 PM",Yes,Concourse
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:34 PM",No,Yeah I try to stay away from airport food. It's not regulated by health inspectors the same way. 
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:36 PM",No,So you never know what you're gonna end up with. 
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:36 PM",No,"Or HOW you're going to end up, for that matter haha"
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:38 PM",Yes,How are we supposed to eat??
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:40 PM",Yes,Oops accidentally double question mark.

+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:43 PM",Yes,Mmhmm can't go wrong with goldfish. Wow that's a lot of stuff lol.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:43 PM",Yes,Are you gonna eat all that yourself?
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:43 PM",No,No haha I'm packing for my sister too. They always mooch off of me lol
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:43 PM",No,Probably because I always come prepared. 
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:46 PM",Yes,I was going to say slip some sleepy stuff into the food they eat... But that would prolly be bad.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:47 PM",No,Hahahaha why would I drug my sisters? Lol 
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:47 PM",No,They'd still mooch anyway
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:47 PM",No,Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:48 PM",Yes,Not if they're sleeping! Bah

+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:52 PM",Yes,I haven't had fruit rollups in a while either.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:53 PM",Yes,"I used to unwrap the entire thing, ball it up, and then let it dissolve in my mouth"
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:54 PM",No,Yeah. That's the best way haha
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:56 PM",Yes,Haha I'm at the bachelor party right now. I don't think the bride is supposed to be here haha.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 5:59 PM",No,She's there? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 5:59 PM",Yes,lol.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 6:04 PM",No,"If you're at a bachelor party, why aren't you getting down with the rest of them? Lol"
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 6:09 PM",Yes,Haha well up until now we weren't really doing anything. Just standing around talking. And I wanted to make sure I wished you a safe flight. But now we just got food so my communication channel will most likely be closing out of proper party etiquette.
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 6:09 PM",Yes,"Plus I'm not one who really... ""Gets down"" haha."
+17069923021,"Jun 12, 2014 6:09 PM",Yes,Granted I can get a little crazy given the opportunity.
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 6:10 PM",No,Hahaha yeah I've seen you get crazy lol
+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 6:10 PM",No,Kinda

+12103557887,"Jun 12, 2014 6:15 PM",No,Okay
+17069923021,"Jun 15, 2014 6:10 PM",Yes,🎵Jessie's on a vacation far away! 🎵 lol. How's your trip going?
+12103557887,"Jun 15, 2014 6:10 PM",No,Hahahaha good

+12103557887,"Jun 15, 2014 9:12 PM",No,It's been pretty great here so far. I've been driving a lot though to get us around everywhere. What time does your flight get in tomorrow?
+17069923021,"Jun 15, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,Group chauffeur haha. I wish I could have driven more this week. I was nearly having a heart attack on ever bend because my friend Phil is a terrible driver. I kept asking him if he would like be to drive. I got in like one stretch but that was it. I come in at 515 tomorrow God willing.
+17069923021,"Jun 15, 2014 11:22 PM",Yes,Right now I'm in this huge seminary. It's really old. I feel like I'm at Hogwarts.
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 12:00 AM",No,"Yeah, I don't mind driving, but my sisters are both very vocal backseat drivers and are horrible at directions so they aren't even good at navigating. Plus, they seem to think that since they're passengers, they should pick the music. Which I'm really not okay with. "
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 12:01 AM",No,"Hogwarts huh? That sounds awesome! Well, have a good flight tomorrow! I was going to say that if you were getting in earlier, that would be a good time to hang out since I'll be in town tomorrow for sure. But I guess that won't work. "
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:11 AM",Yes,the driver should be able to trump whatever music is playing. That's always a rule when I'm driving haha. Cause I've had people out stuff on that makes me want to sleep.
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 12:12 AM",No,That was my problem today. It was all free form jazz malarkey. Ridiculous.
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:14 AM",Yes,Yeah afternoon. It seems like a short flight compared to most of my recent travels.
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:15 AM",Yes,Free form jazz? Just wild random saxxies and such?
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,Phil gave me a tour around the grounds. It's quite impressive. We walked down some of the corridors and into the kitchen. Which was slightly creepy because all the lights were off save the ominous glow of a bug zapper. I'll try to remember to take some pictures of the outside before I leave tomorrow. I have a taxi coming to pick me up at 11.
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,Are you headed to bed?
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 12:24 AM",No,"Yeah, very wild saxes, drums, pianos... I was not a huge fan. \LF\LFMy phone is full of tons of photos from the last three days. It's been pretty crazy, the amount of stuff we've managed to cram in. \LF\LFThat sounds like a relatively long flight then if you're not getting here till 5. Hopefully there aren't any major delays. My flight out here was delayed two hours so I didn't get in until after 1:30am. It was horrific. \LF\LFI'm getting ready for bed, yes. And you should be too! Even though you're a total insomniac night owl. Haha"
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:30 AM",Yes,You gotta post some one Instagram! =D Well I fly at 1240 and have a layover in Chicago. I actually don't remember oh long it was from San Antonio when I went last Christmas. lol Well have a good night then Jessie and I'll try to get some sleep too. g'night!
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 12:31 AM",Yes,*on
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 12:33 AM",No,I'll start posting eventually haha. Goodnight!
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 10:24 AM",Yes,￼It's so pretty!
+12103557887,"Jun 16, 2014 11:39 AM",No,Is that Hogwarts?! So cool!
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 3:18 PM",Yes,It's totes Hogwarts. I think my plane broke lol. They said our aircraft won't be continuing it's service today. Hopefully another option comes up.
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 3:18 PM",Yes,Otherwise I'll be trapped in Chicago haha
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 3:24 PM",Yes,Yay! They found another plane!
+17069923021,"Jun 16, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,I'm racing laps around the Seattle airport in my moms car. I left them at the airport! Woooooooo
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:00 AM",No,"Sorry, my phone was acting up and I had to reset the network settings last night. Your texts didn't even come through until 2am! \LF\LFSounds like you had a rough flight. But that when you got to the airport, things turned more jovial. That's good. "
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:48 AM",Yes,I was pretty sick of traveling by the time I got in. Mostly just because my butt hurt from sitting around hours on end. And I had forgotten that my grandparents were here too. They flew out about 3 hours after I had arrived. Which is why I was driving the car around the airport. So they could check in with my parents and say goodbyes.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:49 AM",Yes,2am! They didn't wake you up did they?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:49 AM",No,Gotcha
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:50 AM",No,I was already awake because I had to pick up my mom and kids from the airport at 12:45. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:50 AM",No,Did I tell you they were all coming too?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:50 AM",No,That was kind of a last minute thing... Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:51 AM",Yes,Haha no you didn't. That's great though! I'm sure they're happy to be up here with you.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:52 AM",No,Yeah. They're pretty excited. I was able to keep it a surprise for them until they were almost at the airport last night. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:55 AM",Yes,Haha so they had no idea they were coming??
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 AM",No,"Nope, none at all"
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 AM",Yes,Awww that's so cool.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 AM",No,Haha yeah
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 AM",No,I'm usually not that great at keeping secrets. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 AM",No,Turned out okay this time though. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:02 PM",Yes,I used to be terrible with secrets as a kid. To the point where no one in my family would let me in on anything. I've gotten really good at it though lol. Well I know we talked about hanging out but don't feel like you have to or that you're going to make me feel bad if we don't. Family is really important. =)
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:04 PM",Yes,I know you don't have like a super long time up here with them.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:13 PM",Yes,not that I wouldn't be dissapointed. But.. I can't word today I have the dumb. You know what I'm trying to say right? lol
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:12 PM",No,Hahahaha yeah I gotcha. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:15 PM",No,"We're going to Port Angeles today and tomorrow, but we'll be back in Seattle on Thursday. I can let you know what's going on for Thursday if you'd like. "
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:33 PM",Yes,I will most likely be in Portland most of the day on Thursday. My brother gets one day off each week. And Thursday is his day off this week.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:33 PM",Yes,And you leave Friday in the super AM right?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:33 PM",No,Oh okay
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:33 PM",No,Yeah super am. Like waking up at 3:45am. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:33 PM",No,😩
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:35 PM",Yes,😿
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:36 PM",Yes,Hey not everything works out. But that's ok. =)
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:37 PM",Yes,Have your kids been to the Aquarium?
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 12:38 PM",Yes,You have all of Thursday to have a super adventure with them! 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 12:53 PM",No,"No, they haven't been. This is their first time here. The whole week will be a super adventure! It'll be exciting. "
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 7:06 PM",Yes,So what are you doing in Port Angeles?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 7:53 PM",No,"Hurricane Ridge, the pier in Port Angeles, the Marina, the tide pools at Salt Creek, and Dungeness Spit. All before tomorrow evening when we drive back to Seattle. 😟"
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Oh my! That's quite a load of stuff. What's the sad face for? Not enough time?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:16 PM",No,Just putting a lot into a short period of time so it gets exhausting. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:16 PM",No,That was more of a concerned face. Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,lol exhaustion can wait when there is fun to be had.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,Or relieving exhaustion.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,Sleeping ... We can take it easy when we're dead lol.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:18 PM",No,"Yeah but two kids, controlling mom, and bossy sister adds to the exhaustion a bit. Lol. "
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Well yeah there's that haha.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:18 PM",No,It would be different if it was just the kids and I. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:18 PM",No,You'd think I would be the most bossy as the eldest. But I'm actually not. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Odd how that turned out. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,Yeah that does seem a little off for the typical sibling order. My sister is like a drill sergeant.
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,But you don't seem like a pushover either.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:20 PM",No,I'm more of a motherly type. And I'm not a pushover per say but I don't like conflict either so if I know it's a pointless thing to argue I just give up. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,So what were you able to get to today on your list of attractions?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Just Hurricane Ridge. Unfortunately. Tomorrow's gonna be packed. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:25 PM",Yes,Only one? What is hurricane ridge?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:24 PM",No,But the kids got to play in snow for the first time ever. So it was totally worth it. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:24 PM",No,It's one of the Cascade mountain peaks in the Olympic National Forest. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:26 PM",Yes,They were both born in San Antonio right? 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:26 PM",No,Yeah
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:28 PM",Yes,I lurve snow! I remember my first experience with it after living in Florida for years. I'll bet they had a blast. Was it thick and fluffy? Snowball worthy?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:28 PM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Pretty much
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:31 PM",Yes,It's was so beautiful out! Where was my sun today?? Haha
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:30 PM",No,You were too far south I guess. Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,Are you going sailing at the Marina?
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:35 PM",No,No. There's an aquatic exhibit with pools of tidal creatures you can touch. Thought that would be cool for the kids. It's not very big but it's cheap. Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,Like these guys? 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9_b6_6ZHpzc
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,=D
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:42 PM",No,"No. Haha more like sea stars, sea urchins, sea anemones, kelp, that kind of stuff. "
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,"""Hey! hey! Hey!"" Haha wait don't urchins sting?"
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:47 PM",No,Not necessarily. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:50 PM",Yes,Sea stars are scary.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:50 PM",No,Not even. They're super cool. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,Actually I don't know if I could will myself to touch any of the things you listed. Other than kelp
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:51 PM",No,They don't bite! Lol
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,They're creepy!
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:51 PM",No,Hahahaha no
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,They have little thingies on the bottom of they're... Feet? Legs?
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,They're amazing of course. But they kinda creep me out.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:54 PM",No,The suction cups keep them from getting pulled away with the tides. 
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:54 PM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:56 PM",Yes,Just look at the terror! ￼Hahahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:57 PM",Yes,They're actually quite elegant creatures. But I would still be uneasy when it came to touching one.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:58 PM",No,You don't touch that side! You touch the top hahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,But what if I want to. Are you allowed to?
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,I guess picking them up would be frowned upon.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:58 PM",No,Well you don't want to unstick them. It can damage their legs. They're pretty fragile. 
+17069923021,"Jun 17, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,Oh wait. It's a tide pool not a display ran by people.
+12103557887,"Jun 17, 2014 11:58 PM",No,If they're just floating around you can pick them up. Just have to keep them in the water. 
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:00 AM",No,"The one in the marina is run by people. The beach, of course, is not. "
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,Somehow my mind wandered to aquarium things.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,One of my favourite things to do as a child at the beach was digging holes and catching all the tiny clam things that washed ashore. Then watching them dig into the sand.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,Watching them dig was so fascinating.
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:02 AM",No,Yeah. That's gulf coast stuff though haha
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:02 AM",No,The beaches here are different. 
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:04 AM",Yes,"I'd scoop them out, rinse them off, and watch them dig again. The poor guys. Yeah I know. I've really only been to the Florida beaches."
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:04 AM",Yes,Except for Maine. That was really different
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:05 AM",No,You should do an Oregon or Washington beach while you're here. Very different experience.  
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,I need someone to go with. I doubt my parents would want to go.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:07 AM",Yes,Maybe my sister. I just found out she's actually coming up too.
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:10 AM",No,Then go with her! I can make all kinds of recommendations!
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,Where do I go?? What do I do??
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:14 AM",Yes,Do I have to get in the water? lol
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:17 AM",No,Depends on what you want to do. And probably not for the water bit. It's like 50 degrees! Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,My grandfather paid me a dollar for ever minute I stood in the water up to my waist in Maine. I think it was in the fall. I think I lasted like 6 minutes.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,Buurrrr
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:21 AM",Yes,What do you reccomend me doing?
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:24 AM",No,"Hmmm well the tide pools are cool, but those are only at a few specific beaches. Dungeness Spit is one of the better beaches in Washington and you get to hike through rainforest to get there so it's kinda the best of both worlds. La Push has three different beaches with three different types of environments, but it's pretty far out there. "
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:25 AM",No,If you're going to Oregon though it's gotta be Canon Beach. 
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:28 AM",Yes,Those are all in Port Angeles? Save Canon beach.
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:30 AM",No,"They're all within the vicinity. Dungeness Spit is maybe ten miles before PA, some of the tide pool beaches are like 25 miles after PA, and La Push is probably 60 miles past PA on highway 101. It's all really pretty driving so it doesn't feel like it's taking forever, but it's definitely not a there and back in a few hours kind of thing. "
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:34 AM",Yes,Dungeness Spit sounds like a place where you would find dragons.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:37 AM",Yes,Maybe I could talk my sister into adventuring with me. Although... She is like 6 months pregnant.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:39 AM",Yes,Is PA north of Seattle?
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 12:39 AM",Yes,I should just spend a few minutes studying a map.
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 12:18 PM",No,"PA is Northwest of Seattle. About 2 1/2 hours if you take the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, 1 1/2 hours if you take a ferry from Seattle to Bainbridge Island. She should be fine to explore at six months pregnant, probably not the tide pools though, cause they can get really slippery and there's a pretty big chance for falling on the rocks. "
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 2:11 PM",Yes,Have fun today!
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 2:12 PM",No,You too!
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 3:48 PM",Yes,Forgive me if I asked you this. Are you allergic to shellfish?  
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 3:52 PM",No,Not allergic. But I don't eat them. Don't care for the taste. 
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 4:17 PM",Yes,"Yeah, I had originally meant to ask you when you told me you didn't eat it. I wouldn't have pegged you as a non shellfish eater."
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 4:19 PM",No,Really? Why? Haha
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 4:22 PM",Yes,Haha idk. Your from Washington? So you would think sea creatures are tasty.
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 4:22 PM",Yes,I guess that would make me like seafood too though.
+12103557887,"Jun 18, 2014 6:55 PM",No,I dunno it made me feel a bit of an aversion for seafood because of the constant fish smell I grew up around. 
+17069923021,"Jun 18, 2014 9:31 PM",Yes,Are you guys still out and about? What did you get to today?
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 10:35 AM",No,"Sorry, I was driving on the highway. We didn't get back to Seattle till after 10:30 and I passed out shortly thereafter. We went to the pier and the Marina in PA, Marymere Falls, and Ediz Hook (it's a beach). We also saw my mom's friend and my Uncle and cousins. Then we took the ferry back from Bainbridge Island. It was good. "
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 10:51 AM",No,"And, Happy Birthday too! Enjoy it while you're in one of the most beautiful states around! "
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:20 PM",Yes,That sounds like quite a bit. I'm glad you had fun. Are you hitting the aquarium today? And thank you. It means a lot. You were actually the first person to say anything about it. =)
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 1:22 PM",No,Was I? Hahaha
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 1:22 PM",No,"We'll be doing stuff downtown, yes, but I'm not sure about the aquarium. My sister found a comic bookstore she wants to go to. So I'm going to be accommodating and take her there for a bit. "
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:28 PM",Yes,You were. And I had already been up with my parents for a while. Comic books!
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 1:29 PM",No,Oh parents....
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,Yeah.. I went to a game store yesterday. They had some really cool stuff and lots of puzzles.
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,Have you ever played Munchkin?
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 1:32 PM",No,"I don't think so, no. "
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:36 PM",Yes,"Well, we might just need to fix that haha. It's fun when you have lots of people."
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:41 PM",Yes,"It's a card game. You are with all the other players in a ""dungeon"" with monsters. But its designed to be really funny. The artwork is pretty comical too. There's are thing that happen such as, getting cursed and being required to wear a chicken on your head or losing levels because you picked up a duck."
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 1:42 PM",No,Sounds silly 
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 1:42 PM",Yes,It's very silly.
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 2:11 PM",No,But in a good way 
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:12 PM",Yes,=( that puzzle from the dollar store is missing a piece.
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:12 PM",Yes,I'm not sure if I lost it. Or it was missing from the beginning.
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:12 PM",Yes,But it makes me sad.
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 6:13 PM",No,It's missing a piece? Hahahaha I bet it got stuck up underneath something somewhere. 
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:14 PM",Yes,I looked everywhere! I seriously searched all over my apartment. I'm tempted to go out and find the same one and redo it so I can find the missing piece.
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 6:14 PM",No,Hahahahaha
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 6:15 PM",No,"Just take a piece of paper, lay it under, and draw the missing piece instead. That could be just as fun lol"
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:15 PM",Yes,Haha. I suck at drawing though.
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:16 PM",Yes,You'd have to draw it lol
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 6:16 PM",Yes,Mine would look like an etch a sketch
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 6:35 PM",No,I can't draw! Hahaha I couldn't even handle an etch a sketch 
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 7:12 PM",Yes,Well I guess I'll suck it up and draw a stick window lol.
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 7:12 PM",No,Hahahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 19, 2014 7:13 PM",Yes,"I really wanted to frame it haha. Having a missing piece might be a good conversation starter haha. Although the conversation would be short... ""So what's with the missing piece?"" ""I lost it."""
+12103557887,"Jun 19, 2014 7:20 PM",No,Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 8:15 AM",Yes,Have a safe flight home!
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 1:05 PM",No,Thanks. In Houston for the layover. 
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 5:33 PM",Yes,Did your mom and the kids have the same flight back as you?
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:35 PM",No,Yes. It was a long day. 
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 5:37 PM",Yes,Oh goodness. And your sisters too? A big caravan?
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:40 PM",No,A big one. 
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:40 PM",No,Full of grumps. 
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 5:42 PM",Yes,Well you guys did get up pretty early haha.
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:43 PM",No,Very. I've been up for 14 hours already. 
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:43 PM",No,Make that 14 1/2. 
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 5:55 PM",Yes,Are you grumpy?
+12103557887,"Jun 20, 2014 5:55 PM",No,Haha yes
+17069923021,"Jun 20, 2014 6:02 PM",Yes,I'm sorry lol.
+17069923021,"Jul 3, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,"Hey, We haven't talked in like two weeks! What's up?"
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:21 AM",Yes,Happy America day!
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:22 AM",No,You too! I didn't want to text you yet this morning in case it woke you up. I was at a wedding last night. How's the PNW treating you? I see you finally got to go to the aquarium. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:33 AM",Yes,Thanks for your consideration. My friend Andrew actually woke me up at 530 this morning. -_- haha. I wasn't super happy about it. I love it here! The buildings are just so beautiful. I would love to get a sports pilot license and fly an ultralight around.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:34 AM",No,If you check on Groupon you might be able to find a deal for a helicopter tour over the city. I saw one a month ago for Seattle. Maybe you could still find one. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:34 AM",Yes,The aquarium was very well kept. The jellies had a very clean and safe tank. I was really sad at the Florida aquarium last time I went. They're jelly tank was awful.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:37 AM",Yes,Helicopter ride would have been pretty cool. We were pretty limited with our time though. I only finally got to Seattle yesturday. And I'm headed back right now. I'm actually at the airport.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:40 AM",No,Oh! Haha I was totally doing a whole speech about other stuff you could have done in Seattle. Whoops. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,It's kind hard to plan with my family sometimes. My sister ended coming up. I didn't know she was going to be there the same time as me. And my brother is terrible at communicating with us. Plus my sister and brother have a horrible relationship. And my sister had to be hospitalized while she was here. Haha it was quite the family visit.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:46 AM",No,"Oh geez. I'm sorry. I think all families have too much drama sometimes. My trip almost got ruined by my sisters too, so I completely understand. But it looked like you had a fair amount of fun despite all of the sibling issues. "
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:52 AM",Yes,I wish I could just sit them both down and slap them and give 'em a good talking too. Haha
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:53 AM",Yes,But no I did have tons of fun. I'm kinda sad I can't stay longer. But it's been almost an entire month.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:53 AM",No,Yeah. Siblings don't work that way though. Unfortunately. Eventually they'll figure it out. 
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:53 AM",No,"Yeah, you've been gone a while! "
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:54 AM",Yes,So how was the wedding?
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:55 AM",No,"It was alright. Sat around for like two hours between the ceremony and when they actually started the real reception. And it was outside for the ceremony, so that sucked. 97 degree weather is not ideal for an outdoor wedding. "
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:55 AM",No,"And then the DJ didn't start playing music till like 9:30, but the reception started at 6:30. So that was weird. "
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:56 AM",Yes,That's a tad late.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:57 AM",No,Yeah. Pretty much  
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:57 AM",Yes,Groomsmen must have been soaked in sweat.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:57 AM",Yes,Ok taking off! Txt you when I land. =)
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 12:03 PM",No,Alright. Have a safe flight!
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 2:47 PM",Yes,Las Vegas! I've never been here before. To bad I don't have enough time to explore a bit.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 2:49 PM",No,Your layover is in Vegas? That's weird. I would've though Phoenix for sure. 
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 2:49 PM",No,*thought
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:03 PM",Yes,I hit Phoenix and Denver last Christmas. It was really cool flying in. Huge hotel and casino buildings. I was trying to see if I could recognize any from movies. There are slot machines littered all over the airport.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 3:04 PM",No,I bet there are. I'm going to Vegas in August with some friends for a birthday. I'm not sure if I should be excited or not haha
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:16 PM",Yes,"Oh my, are they partiers? "
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 3:24 PM",No,Haha some of them. Not all. 
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 3:26 PM",No,"But I've never been so I figured, why not?"
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:49 PM",Yes,I would love to go. I've mentioned it to my friend Phil several times.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:50 PM",Yes,Haha I'm not sure what I would do here. But I'd figure something out haha.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 3:50 PM",No,You could go see all the shows. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:51 PM",Yes,Like this one? ￼
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 3:52 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 3:57 PM",No,"I was thinking more along the lines of Penn and Teller or Cirque du Soleil. But hey, whatever floats your boat Hahahaha"
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 4:02 PM",Yes,Oooh yeah Penn and Teller. I forgot about those guys.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 4:05 PM",No,Hahaha they're still around 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:26 PM",Yes,Yay! I'm home!
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:26 PM",No,Long day huh? 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:28 PM",Yes,Yup. I was bored outta my mind on the plane.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:28 PM",Yes,But I used it as an opportunity to home my patience.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:28 PM",No,Didn't bring a book? 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:28 PM",Yes,I did. But I didn't feel like reading.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:29 PM",No,I understand. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:29 PM",Yes,*hone
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:29 PM",No,I get the same way on planes sometimes. 
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:29 PM",No,Are you just going home and relaxing for the night?
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:31 PM",Yes,Andrew invited me to grill out with him and some other friends of his. Haven't decided if I'm joining him or not.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:32 PM",Yes,I don't particularly feel too keen on hanging out with a bunch of people I don't know right now.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:32 PM",No,Yeah. Plane rides can be exhausting. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,My first flight was quite pleasant. The flight was 1 person shy of being full. And the empty spot was between me and my copilot. So we stuffed our bags into the middle seat so we could have extra leg room.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:40 PM",Yes,He had a pen explode on him during the flight! It was a mess!
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:40 PM",No,You lucked out! 
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:40 PM",No,"Oh, maybe not hahaha"
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 7:41 PM",Yes,Haha well he didn't get any on me. He was really friendly too. Definitely one of the better flights I've been on.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 7:42 PM",No,That's good. At least it wasn't a horrible flight. I've had a couple of those. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,I opted to be social.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 8:28 PM",No,Uh oh haha
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 8:28 PM",No,Well hopefully that's a good thing 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Yeah me too. lol. But makin myself socially uncomfortable occasionally is for the best I think.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 8:30 PM",Yes,So I jus charged in guns a blazing.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Guns blazing huh? Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,Any fireworks for you tonight?
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,Or did you go sleepy? No sleepy! It's a Friday night! =D well have a good night if you did go to bed. Hope the fireworks don't keep you up.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 10:09 PM",No,Oh I'm watching Star Wars haha
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 10:11 PM",No,"I'm not the big pyro like you though. There's fireworks going off around us, but I'm not setting them off. "
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 10:55 PM",Yes,Which one? I'm actually not participating too much. I wasn't involved with the purchasing of said pyrotechnics.
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 10:56 PM",Yes,I did get shrapnelled in the face though. Not a result of my actions.
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:01 PM",No,Yikes! I hope you're okay!
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:01 PM",No,And A New Hope. 
+17069923021,"Jul 4, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,I am. ￼
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:20 PM",No,"Well, good. "
+12103557887,"Jul 4, 2014 11:22 PM",No,I can't imagine being hit in the face by a firework. 
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:42 AM",Yes,Sooo my home has been invaded by these little tiny flies. I have a suspicion that my houses sitter left dishes and food out often.
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:47 AM",No,Who watched your house? 
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:47 AM",No,And are they prone to being dirty? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:48 AM",Yes,Imy friend Andrew. I thought he was rather neat. Which is why I agreed when he asked if I needed someone to watch the house lol.
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:49 AM",No,Oh Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:49 AM",No,That sucks 
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:49 AM",Yes,Oh boy. I just took a look in my dish cupboard. This stuff is not washed properly.
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:49 AM",No,Can you get a fly trap thing? Like one of the sticky things that attracts them? 
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:49 AM",Yes,Do you know where I'd find one of those?
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:50 AM",No,"HEB, Home Depot, Lowe's...probably any place that carries those kind of things. Maybe even at Target. "
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:51 AM",No,They're gnats right? 
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:51 AM",No,And you should make him go back and wash your dishes again haha
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:52 AM",Yes,I am washing them now lol. Yeah gnatty things.
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 10:54 AM",Yes,Made any lunches with your coworkers yet?
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 10:56 AM",No,"No, we've kind of been all over the place during lunch time so far haha. We've had doctors appointments and meetings, all kinds of stuff. And then one of the ladies is getting moved to a different department in a week, so we'll be even less likely to have lunches together at that point. Oh well.... Summers can be crazy I guess. "
+17069923021,"Jul 6, 2014 11:07 AM",Yes,Aww I'm sorry. Who is leaving?
+12103557887,"Jul 6, 2014 11:17 AM",No,"Susie. The one who sits across from me. It's good for her though because the schedule will be better for her family. And we'll still get to see eachother, just not every day. "
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,Batman cats? ￼
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Hahahaha Joker!!!!!

+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:36 PM",No,"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention lol"
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Haha why? 
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Because I got it wrong? Lol
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,Cause you said the wrong thing. The batman police are coming for you.
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:37 PM",No,The Catman police?

+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:39 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:40 PM",No,I did count them lol
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:40 PM",No,😁
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,I thought you might lol
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:40 PM",No,It's the curse of the nerds 
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:43 PM",Yes,Nerds are the best breed though.
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:42 PM",No,A slowly dying one
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:44 PM",Yes,What? no I don't think so. Why do you say that?
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:44 PM",No,I was trying to make it seem more elite lol
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,Oh oh.. *cough cough* I mean.. Yes.. A once dominating race.. now dwindling; driven into the deepest corners of the land.
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:46 PM",No,Forced to go into hiding in order to avoid extinction. 
+17069923021,"Jul 8, 2014 8:49 PM",Yes,Haha you're hilarious. well I gotta get back on the floor. Oh have to been to that mirror maze downtown? I think they have a room with lasers you have to step around too. I was gonna see if some people wanted to go.
+12103557887,"Jul 8, 2014 8:50 PM",No,"Mirror maze? I don't know what that is. So, the answer is obviously no haha"
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 1:43 PM",Yes,Well it's like a maze... But the walls are mirrors. And I think it's supposed I be kinda dark inside. So it's more disoriented.
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 1:43 PM",Yes,*ing
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 3:54 PM",Yes,It sounds a maze... ing

+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 4:38 PM",No,Is it a scary maze? 
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 6:20 PM",Yes,I don't think it is. It's just supposed to be confusing. I think it has a bunch of blue and UV lighting.
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 6:24 PM",Yes,And in the same building they have a laser tripwire room. Like those ridiculous ones in the movies when thirds are trying to enter a vault. Are you bendy? Haha
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 6:25 PM",Yes,On a scale of pretzel to spaghetti how bendy are you?
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 6:37 PM",No,Hahaha is soft pretzel an option? 
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 6:38 PM",No,"I mean, I can't do the splits or anything, but I can touch my toes "
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 6:38 PM",No,And I'm pretty small...
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 7:41 PM",Yes,Soft pretzels are only an option if you're buttery. lol
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 7:42 PM",Yes,I haven't been there so I haven't any idea how hardcore the lasers are. Supposedly they have different difficulties. I'm hoping its challenging.
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Buttery? Haha that sounds completely unappealing. 
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,What? Soft pretzels are supposed to be buttery though.
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:01 PM",No,"Maybe a soft pretzel, but certainly not a human soft pretzel. "
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:05 PM",No,If I was covered in butter I'd immediately want a sea salt scrub followed by a long hard shower. Haha
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 8:05 PM",Yes,Haha sea salt.
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 8:05 PM",Yes,Then you'd really be a pretzel.
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:05 PM",No,"Well, it would cut through the butter best. "
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:06 PM",No,Hahaha noooooo
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Toss you in the oven on 425 and you'd be good to go in 20 minutes.
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:07 PM",No,Haha except I don't do well with heat. I blister and burn too easily. 
+17069923021,"Jul 9, 2014 8:12 PM",Yes,Wait... So do you have experience being slathered in butter? Or is the salt thing just some common knowledge I'm not aware of.
+12103557887,"Jul 9, 2014 8:13 PM",No,"Hahaha I was just guessing. But a sea salt scrub is the best way to get grease, grime, or dead skin off of you, so it made sense to me. "
+17069923021,"Jul 10, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,So does that sound like something you would like to do?
+12103557887,"Jul 10, 2014 10:39 PM",No,Yeah I'm down 
+12103557887,"Jul 10, 2014 10:39 PM",No,When are you thinking of going? 
+17069923021,"Jul 11, 2014 4:07 PM",Yes,I don't have a day yet. Just sometime in the next week or two. Any days specifically good for you?
+12103557887,"Jul 11, 2014 4:07 PM",No,Hmmm. Day or evening? 
+17069923021,"Jul 11, 2014 6:20 PM",Yes,I would imagine evenings to be better for everyone.
+17069923021,"Jul 11, 2014 6:21 PM",Yes,Or would you rather do it on a Friday during the day? I don't really have a preference.
+12103557887,"Jul 12, 2014 2:48 PM",No,"Sorry, I thought this sent last night:\LFAs long as it's when the kids are with their Dad I should be fine. This weekend is obviously too short of notice and I have the kids next weekend. So, I could go Thursday night the 24th, Friday the 25th anytime, Saturday the 26th I've got plans, and Sunday the 27th should be fine anytime as well. So I guess just let me know what you plan and I'll do my best to be there. "
+17069923021,"Jul 13, 2014 4:48 PM",Yes,Okie dokie. Have you been having issues with iMessage? It's giving me tons of trouble with multiple people
+12103557887,"Jul 13, 2014 5:06 PM",No,I have been having problems with it on and off for a while. Resetting your network settings seems to help. 
+17069923021,"Jul 13, 2014 5:07 PM",Yes,Yeah I tried that and it seems to work but it's back to not sending again within a few days.
+12103557887,"Jul 13, 2014 5:09 PM",No,Yeah mine did the same thing. I've had to reset it like 5 times since February. Have you taken it to the apple store yet? 
+17069923021,"Jul 13, 2014 5:10 PM",Yes,I haven't. Have you done that? It seems like. Software issue to me so I just figured they would patch it or something.
+12103557887,"Jul 13, 2014 5:19 PM",No,I went and they told me what to do. I don't remember what it was called. But it worked. 
+17069923021,"Jul 13, 2014 5:19 PM",Yes,And you haven't had any issues since?
+12103557887,"Jul 13, 2014 5:23 PM",No,I've still had to reset the network settings twice. But other than that it's been fine. 
+17069923021,"Jul 13, 2014 5:45 PM",Yes,So how's your Sunday going?
+12103557887,"Jul 13, 2014 6:10 PM",No,Good. Running errands and such. 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 4:30 PM",Yes,"Ok so were gonna do the maze and tripwire room around 4 on Sunday. Kris and his girlfriend and Gerry. Reggie is off too, but I haven't gotten a chance to talk to him about it yet."
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 4:30 PM",No,Works for me! 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 4:30 PM",Yes,Yay!
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 4:33 PM",Yes,It's $15 for the pass. And it's all day.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 4:34 PM",No,For both the maze and the laser room?
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 6:14 PM",Yes,It's one price that includes both. And I think I found a coupon that will give us a dollar off each of our tickets.
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 6:14 PM",Yes,Also were prolly gonna carpool.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 6:17 PM",No,Okay. Sounds good. Does that mean we need to take my car since it seats six?
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:09 PM",Yes,I can TOTALLY fit 6 people.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:09 PM",No,Do you have six seatbelts? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:09 PM",Yes,How does you car fit 6? It's like the same as mine.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:10 PM",No,Not even hahaha 
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:10 PM",No,I have three rows of two seats
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,Are you serious?? Your car doesn't seem that big. Haha I guess I never really payed that close attention to the inside.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:10 PM",No,Yeah I'm serious haha
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,You have a clown car!
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:12 PM",No,But maybe it's because I usually have the back row folded down. 
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:12 PM",No,It's not a clown car Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:12 PM",Yes,3 rows at that size? Totally a clown car.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:12 PM",No,No no no Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:14 PM",Yes,Well I was planning on driving. Unless you really wanted to. I know how scary I can be behind the wheel lol.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:14 PM",No,Haha it's up to you
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:14 PM",No,The offer is there just in case. 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,I guess we'll see how many peoples we end up with. We might have to take two cars.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:18 PM",No,True true
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:24 PM",Yes,We're also playing Pokemon on Thursday haha. I wasn't sure if you would be up for that or not. In a matter of a couple of weeks Louie and I have convinced 6 people at work to buys cards and start playing with us.
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:24 PM",No,Who is Louie? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:25 PM",Yes,Jose our cart attendant. Goes by Louie
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:25 PM",No,Oh gotcha 
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:25 PM",No,"Yeah, I'll probably skip out on the Pokemon haha"
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:26 PM",Yes,Totally missing out but whatever lol. ;D
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:27 PM",No,Oh geez 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:27 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:28 PM",No,I've honestly never even seen an episode of Pokemon before. 
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:29 PM",Yes,I think I've seen maybe 3. It's not that great. Ash is very whiny.
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:30 PM",Yes,"I was always more into the games, which do to follow the story aside from being set in the same universe "
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:30 PM",Yes,*dont follow
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,"Oh okay. Well, I haven't even ever seen anything to do with the games so I'd be lost there too. "
+17069923021,"Jul 22, 2014 9:46 PM",Yes,"It's a pretty simple card game. no need prior knowledge needed to play. But yeah, if you don't have any interest in playing that's ok. I was just teasing you a little. You can sleep now. lol"
+12103557887,"Jul 22, 2014 9:50 PM",No,Haha thanks. I was just about to say I was headed to bed. These 4:45am wake up times are no fun!
+17069923021,"Jul 23, 2014 5:47 PM",Yes,You poor thing. I forgot you had to get up so earlier. Do you leave later too? Or just early arrival.
+12103557887,"Jul 23, 2014 5:47 PM",No,They're ten hour days. So I work 6-4:30. Early in and late out. 
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:15 PM",Yes,Woohoo! Sfunday!
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,Saturday is finally coming to a close
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,Still on for tomorrow?
+12103557887,"Jul 26, 2014 9:16 PM",No,Yup. Still going. 
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:22 PM",Yes,I'm hoping it will keep us busy for a while. But if it ends up being really short there's always board games. You haven't played bezzerwizzer with us yet have you?
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:22 PM",Yes,Or have you played it at all?
+12103557887,"Jul 26, 2014 9:22 PM",No,Haha what? No I've certainly never played that before. 
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:26 PM",Yes,It's fun to say with a pseudo-French accent haha. It's a trivia board game you play with teams. The questions are very diverse though; sometimes even bizarre.
+12103557887,"Jul 26, 2014 9:25 PM",No,Haha sounds fun
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:26 PM",Yes,I'm most certain we've had this exact conversation before now that I think about it.
+17069923021,"Jul 26, 2014 9:27 PM",Yes,*almost
+12103557887,"Jul 26, 2014 9:27 PM",No,It was close. But not exactly the same haha
+12103557887,"Jul 27, 2014 2:30 PM",No,"I'm sorry to bail, but I'm dealing with some family stuff and I'm not going to be able to meet up with you guys this afternoon. I'm sorry. "
+17069923021,"Jul 27, 2014 2:43 PM",Yes,Don't sweat it. Kris dropped out too. I think the rest of us are just gonna play some pokemon instead. Hope you're still able to have some fun today. =) I pray everything works out for you too.
+12103557887,"Jul 27, 2014 2:44 PM",No,"Thanks. It'll all work out the way it's supposed to, I'm sure. Have fun"
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 5:11 PM",Yes,Hey if you ever have any ideas for doing something crazy or silly let me know. I miss hanging out with you!
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 5:13 PM",No,"Yeah I can let you know. It's been a difficult summer for me in many ways. Lots of family stuff going on. And I'll be moving in a month to my own place, so that's gonna be just as crazy. But I'll definitely keep you in mind. I still owe you cookies too (I haven't forgotten)!"
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:22 PM",Yes,I'm sorry stuff's been so hard for you. You're a hardcore lady though. At least you seem pretty resilient to me. Cookies! =D I've been wanting to make some more. But I know I would just eat them all... So much sugar. I won a contest at work last week. One like where you guess how many pieces are in the jar. I gave all of it to Matt and Sarah. It was tough.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:40 PM",No,Hahaha sounds fun
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:49 PM",No,I've never done well with those games. 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,Ok think of a number between 1 and 10 inclusive.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,Well... I mean I'm thinking of one.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,You guess lol.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:50 PM",No,Hahahahahaha
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:50 PM",No,Uh....
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:51 PM",No,Six 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:51 PM",Yes,!!!
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:51 PM",Yes,3. Six is a multiple of 3 though!
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:55 PM",No,"Yeah, but I still didn't get it right haha"
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:57 PM",Yes,What about Rock Paper Scissors?
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,I bet you're good at that.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 7:59 PM",No,Nope not really haha
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,"Ok, right now. Bring it lol"
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:12 PM",No,Hahaha how?
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:16 PM",Yes,I'll think of one. Then you shoot me your answer
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,I've already got mine
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:18 PM",No,Scissors 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:22 PM",Yes,Ouch. Paper. You got me. 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:22 PM",Yes,Best two outta three?
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:23 PM",No,Hahaha sure
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:23 PM",Yes,Ok I got mine.

+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:24 PM",Yes,ok tie breaker.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:24 PM",No,You can infer intensity? That's new
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,I am inferring it.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Haha okay
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,Ok ready

+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:26 PM",Yes,How
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,You chose scissors three times.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,I can't read you when you do that hahaha
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Hahaha why?
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,Cause it throws me off lol. There's no sense of pattern.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:28 PM",No,It was totally a pattern lol
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Well yeah but. Now helpful for me lol.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:29 PM",No,Hahaha I thought you were trying to let me win something 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,I still have to try to beat you lol. I can't turn off my competitive spirit just like that. :P
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:31 PM",No,Fair enough lol
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:32 PM",No,I don't really win much. Ever...
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:48 PM",Yes,=(
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:48 PM",Yes,I can train you in Rock Paper Scissors
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:49 PM",Yes,I mean aside from the fact that you beat me.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:49 PM",Yes,With your confusing choice of hand guestures.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 8:52 PM",Yes,What types of games are you good at?
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 8:54 PM",No,Hmmm. I do well with games like Boggle and Balderdash. Word related games. Sometimes. I don't mind not winning. 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,Balderdash.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,Is
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,Amazing.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:03 PM",Yes,Are you going to bed soon? I don't want to keep you up.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 9:05 PM",No,Probably in about an hour. I'm still getting stuff ready for tomorrow. 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,Okies
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,I've learned myself quite a few vocabs playin' that game.
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 9:12 PM",No,I haven't played it in quite some time. 
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:23 PM",Yes,I wish I had it. I think the best board game I have is bezzerwizzer.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:23 PM",Yes,You've heard me rave about that one enough though I'm sure haha
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 9:24 PM",No,"I have it. My board game stash is decent. But yeah, I've never played bezzerwizzer. "
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:27 PM",Yes,I think you broiling it over once. But we didn't play it.
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:27 PM",Yes,Zomg brought
+12103557887,"Jul 30, 2014 9:28 PM",No,Yeah haha I did
+17069923021,"Jul 30, 2014 9:37 PM",Yes,You know what would be fun. Getting a hold of some foreign games.

+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 5:21 PM",No,I think anything which bites me leaves a massive welt behind. Unfortunately. 
+17069923021,"Jul 31, 2014 5:22 PM",Yes,When did you gt bit? Just today?

+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 5:58 PM",No,Yeah I've signed a lease on a townhouse
+17069923021,"Jul 31, 2014 6:01 PM",Yes,I'm excited for you.
+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 6:00 PM",No,Yeah hopefully it works out okay 
+17069923021,"Jul 31, 2014 6:02 PM",Yes,Will Caeden and Kailani have to change schools at all?
+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 6:02 PM",No,Yeah. They'll be going to public school this year. 
+17069923021,"Jul 31, 2014 6:03 PM",Yes,How're they handling that? 
+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 6:05 PM",No,Decently. It'll be better when we're in there and they are getting to start a new life with me. 
+17069923021,"Jul 31, 2014 6:08 PM",Yes,Definitely. I dreaded starting public school. And then changing schools again. But it ended up being one of he best things ever.
+12103557887,"Jul 31, 2014 6:09 PM",No,I don't think they're dreading it. I think it's just been a stressful year overall and they're ready to move on and start a new chapter. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:48 PM",Yes,I found a scorpion today!
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,Not exactly in a preferable place. But I found one none the less.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:49 PM",No,In your apartment? Yuck
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:50 PM",Yes,He... I... I discovered him on my pants after I put them on.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:51 PM",Yes,He was clinging to my inner upper thigh. I nearly had a heart attack.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:53 PM",No,AUGH!!!!!!
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:53 PM",Yes,Yup.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:53 PM",No,I'm having flashbacks to last summer when I got stung on my calf by a scorpion. But I didn't see it like you did. 😖😖😖 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:53 PM",No,What did you do with it?!
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:55 PM",Yes,It's on my counter in a gladware container.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:55 PM",No,Is it alive?!
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,Well yeah haha.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,I coulnt kill it!
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:56 PM",No,Drown that sucker in alcohol!!!!
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,The poor thing is lost and alone.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,I don't think he drinks. I offered him a shot earlier.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:57 PM",Yes,He didn't drink it.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:57 PM",No,"Are you insane? Hahahahaha those things hurt and they're territorial. If you let it go, take him faaaaaar away from your place. And you know exactly what I mean about the alcohol. "
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:57 PM",Yes,Hehe
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,I think I'm gonna hike tomorrow. Maybe I should release him out in the woods?
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,Or in the river bed?
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:59 PM",No,Or....you could just kill him. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:59 PM",Yes,But...
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 7:59 PM",No,Am I heartless or something? I wouldn't even hesitate. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 7:59 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,Maybe you just don't view it the same. Everyone has different perspectives.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,I'm not a fan of taking lives. Big or small.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,Unless it's become a serious pest or threat.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:01 PM",No,"Well, I know that, but if it could potentially harm me in some way, I don't even think. I just react. "
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:03 PM",No,Do you remember the rattlesnake they found outside my office? I was so ready to cut it's head off with a pair of pruning shears. Not even playing around. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,I'm a thrower and a brusher. That's my auto response.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,That poor snake.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:40 PM",No,Mine is sneak and squash. Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,I am by no means an animal activist though haha.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:40 PM",No,And I didn't kill him. James let him go. So stupid. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:41 PM",No,"Those things are dangerous! And so are scorpions, by the way. "
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:42 PM",No,I found out I'm allergic to them. Like so allergic I could die if I were stung close enough to my heart. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Humans are dangerous too ;P
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,Well that's not good. See that's a high threat.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:42 PM",No,"Yeah, but humans don't contain poisonous venom. Unless they have a disease....nevermind. "
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:43 PM",Yes,Not sure if you're making a reference to general diseases or zombies.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:44 PM",Yes,In the case of having a reaction. That would warrant a kill. If not a serious deportation.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:44 PM",No,"Well, Ebola has been a problem lately..."
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:44 PM",No,I was going more with the types of issues we are currently dealing with hahaha
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:45 PM",Yes,You never know when the zombie outbreak will occur lol.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:46 PM",No,"And since zombies are a few years away yet, I was referencing the things like Ebola, HIV, measles, mumps, scarlet fever, the flu, the Black Plague...you know, documented things like that...and not zombies..."
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:49 PM",Yes,"We you saying we should kill off the diseased? It's very utilitarian, but would probably be effective."
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:48 PM",No,"No, that's not what I was saying haha"
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:48 PM",No,"You said people were dangerous too, so I responded by saying that we don't have poisonous venom in us, but then I changed my mind and started listing off the poisonous venoms some humans do have. "
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:50 PM",Yes,Ah ha!
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:50 PM",No,"But I think people have souls, and that animals don't. "
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:50 PM",No,As horrible as that is...
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,Accidentally countering with a point!
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:50 PM",No,Yeah I play my own devil's advocate pretty often haha
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,I don't think animals have souls. But I still see their life as theirs and not mine.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:50 PM",No,That's true. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:53 PM",No,"I should clarify that I would never kill an animal. Just a bug, insect, arachnid, and a poisonous snake. "
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:53 PM",No,And I don't see those things as animals. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,No?
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,I do. Haha
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:53 PM",No,No.......
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:53 PM",No,"Well, there you have it then. "
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:55 PM",Yes,I have a feeling that we would have some seriously deep philosophical conversations given a long enough time.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:55 PM",No,I wouldn't kill a moth or a butterfly though. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:55 PM",No,Probably. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:55 PM",No,I think too much. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:55 PM",No,And I'm passionate. And serious sometimes. 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:56 PM",Yes,Sounds like the correct way to live.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:57 PM",Yes,Being able to transition between being a goof and respecting a serious issue.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:58 PM",No,Yeah but it can be problematic at times. People sometimes think I'm too serious and it scares them off before they really get to know me. 
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 8:59 PM",No,But then I guess they weren't worth my time in the first place...not to be mean or anything...
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 8:59 PM",Yes,"I was about to say, maybe that's a good way to filter out who should be and is your friend."
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:00 PM",No,But I just want people to like me!!! Hahahahaha 
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:01 PM",No,"No, it really is a good way to see if they'd get along with me or not. I'm not good at being a ""superficial friend"". It's all or nothing with me hahaha"
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:02 PM",Yes,It too much work.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:02 PM",No,Agreed
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:04 PM",Yes,"All the people I know that I can't keep as a friend(For various reasons such as not getting along well or fell out of touch etc), I keep on FB. Just in case I need them for something."
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:05 PM",Yes,Like a tool for a specific occasion haha.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:05 PM",No,Hahaha I don't even do that. I unfriend or unfollow people all the time haha
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:05 PM",No,I'm so mean
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,Haha.
+17069923021,"Aug 4, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,That's not mean. I feel like what I do is selfish haha.
+12103557887,"Aug 4, 2014 9:07 PM",No,Not really. It's also not making it obvious that you could care less about them anymore. So it's actually being nicer than me haha
+17069923021,"Aug 5, 2014 12:56 PM",Yes,"Yeah I guess I am nicer haha. Whenever I noticed someone has unfriended me on FB I always wonder why. There should be a little prompt when you do it. ""Please leave a short paragraph telling as to why you were unhappy with this product."" Haha."
+17069923021,"Aug 5, 2014 12:58 PM",Yes,I'm not really sure how I'm going to transport this little guy. I have a small container I can throw into my camel back. The tricky part will be getting him in said container.
+12103557887,"Aug 5, 2014 2:22 PM",No,But most people aren't that great about being honest about their feelings. We care too much about what others think. So even if they gave an explanation it probably wouldn't be a completely honest one. 
+12103557887,"Aug 5, 2014 2:22 PM",No,And as far as the scorpion goes...you know where I stand on that lol
+17069923021,"Aug 5, 2014 2:29 PM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Aug 5, 2014 2:30 PM",Yes,I think it would be easier to share negative feelings. It seems like it tends to be that case for a lot of people. Well actually not to peoples faces though. So you got me there still.
+12103557887,"Aug 5, 2014 2:33 PM",No,"I'm just not good about sharing feelings in general. I internalize everything. I'm perfectly fine with sharing thoughts and beliefs, but not at all with sharing my feelings. "
+17069923021,"Aug 6, 2014 3:32 PM",Yes,Do you have any theories as to why that's the case for you? I think for me I'm afraid of scaring people off. Especially in a case where I have feelings for someone and I don't know if they share the same feelings. If they're a good friend of mine I don't want to weird them out and make things awkward if they don't haha. Or even if it's just telling someone that is behaving in a way that makes me uncomfortable. Ill usually try to steer the conversation or activity another way or leave if that fails.
+17069923021,"Aug 6, 2014 3:34 PM",Yes,"Back to the whole... ""I just want people to like me"" thing haha. Oh brain, why do you not work the way I want you to work."
+12103557887,"Aug 6, 2014 7:29 PM",No,"I know when I was a kid I was really open about sharing how I felt, but when I got into fourth grade I was bullied pretty fiercely by girls all the way through high school, so I kind of shut down. \LF\LFIt was, and still is, hard for me to make friends and to know when it's okay to start opening up to people. So for me, it's due to the history I have with sharing too much and that being taken advantage of that I find it hard to relate to others. \LF\LFI suppose it's about protecting me. I will compartmentalize a lot of what I feel and often will think that I feel a certain way about something or someone, and then when I'm more comfortable with the situation my feelings about it change completely. So, in a way I almost don't allow myself the opportunity to fully experience or appreciate something or someone because I'm so busy being guarded and keeping my feelings stored away in neat and tidy little drawers in my brain. \LF\LFI'm aware that I do this, but I've been doing it for so long it would probably be incredibly difficult to change that behavior. My ex always said I was very cold. Which I know isn't the case, but I think what he was trying to say was that I didn't share my feelings, so it made it seem like I didn't have any, good or bad or anything in between. \LF\LFAnd there's also how awkward I am...I don't pick up on verbal cues so I often misunderstand other people and their feelings or intentions as well. So if a person isn't willing to be patient with me and allow me to ask a lot of odd questions most other people wouldn't ask, then I tend to frustrate them and they lose interest in cultivating a friendship with me. \LF\LFI'm an oddball, not in a bad way, but I ask a lot of questions to help me understand where a person is coming from, and not many people like such intrusive and inquisitive behavior. So that's my take on the whole situation. "
+17069923021,"Aug 6, 2014 7:58 PM",Yes,"Bullying is a hard concept for me. Sometimes I kind of treat it flippantly. Not because I don't care. But because I have little experience with it. So when I hear about it, it doesn't draw my ear immediately. I guess cause I was homeschooled most of my life. Then most of high school was an army school. So it was a pretty rare occurance. And those who did it were reprimanded or deported. It's sad that it continues to go on in school still. Well and life in general. \LF\LFI sometimes feel like I missed a lot of things by not attending a public school. Like would I have been more outgoing given constant practice and exposure.\LF\LFUgh I want to write more but I have to get back on the floor.  Ill continue next chance I get. Thank you for sharing this stuff with me."
+12103557887,"Aug 6, 2014 8:07 PM",No,"From what you've shared with me, I get the sense that you were probably bullied by your brother. Bullying doesn't have to jut happen with people outside of our nuclear family units. My husband bullied me for years. How my kids argue with eachother can often be classified as bullying. \LF\LFThe terrorizing you describe your brother put you through is most likely the same sensation I experienced with kids in school. I see bullying as any time that a person treats another badly on purpose, with intent to hurt them in some way or another. \LF\LFAnd you seem outgoing enough to me. You have many friends and people who make it a point to reach out to you and want to spend time with you. I think you're doing just fine and how you were schooled wasn't a detriment at all. For me, I sometimes wish that I had been homeschooled so that I could have skipped all the years of bullying. But then I just remember that I went through what I did for a specific reason, even if that reason isn't entirely clear to me yet. \LF\LFPsalms 138:8 is my favorite verse for expressing this type of feeling. I find that verse always pops up when I need to be reminded of it's message again. "
+17069923021,"Aug 8, 2014 4:11 PM",Yes,"What you said about my brother makes sense. They're also the times when I could see him looking out for me too. I mean he didn't torture me 24/7. I know he loved me. There're several lessons he taught me growing up about respecting people and life as well as been honorable with intentions. I attribute those values I have to him. I feel like I can't blame him for being the way he was because he was by no means an adult at that time. \LF\LFAnd I don't say this to argue a point. Its merely(another word I like) a thought that popped into my head when you mentioned my brother. I mean kids that bully in school don't go to the kids they bothered on the same day and hug them. Or give up the last slice of pizza out of love. Does the context make the bullying more acceptable? I feel like I would rather my brother have done stuff to me, than to have had him do stuff to strangers at school.\LF\LFAnd I am not at all condoning bullying of any sort. These are simply raw thoughts. Was the bullying from your ex followed with compassion? And if so would you describe it as feeling different from the kids in school? And if I'm intruding on too touchy a subject please stop me or just gloss over my question.\LF\LFI'm also glad I was homeschooled. Like I said, I do wonder if my personality would be a bit different. But I'm glad that I had time with my mother in the early years of it. I also had the opportunity to learn how to teach myself. I basically did middle school on my own without any supervision."
+17069923021,"Aug 8, 2014 4:14 PM",Yes,I looked up that verse earlier you first sent me. Total déjà vu. I think my mother had possible told it to me a couple weeks ago over the phone.
+12103557887,"Aug 8, 2014 7:36 PM",No,"None of the bullying I experienced at school or in marriage was followed by compassion. It was all pretty much the same feeling or sensation. Or rather, I felt the same regardless of who was doing the bullying. \LF\LFYeah that's my favorite verse. And it always seems to pop up when I need it most. God works in mysterious ways. "
+17069923021,"Aug 8, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,I'm feel like I shouldn't have delved there. =\ sorry. And yes he does... He's a bit sneaky.
+12103557887,"Aug 8, 2014 10:22 PM",No,"No, it's fine. You were just asking questions. It's a tough subject because it's still an issue, but that's my life and I'm learning to overcome as I can. "
+17069923021,"Aug 8, 2014 10:29 PM",Yes,"Speaking of wise words. I've noticed a recurring phrase in your places of work. ""Do not speak anything you would not write in ink?"" Or something along those lines. Is there a story behind that?"
+12103557887,"Aug 9, 2014 10:25 AM",No," ""Do not speak anything you wouldn't write in permanent ink, and do not write anything you wouldn't want published for the public to read."" \LFIt's just a concept I've come across over the years I've worked as a manager. I've heard things similar to this phrase, but I tweaked it and made it my own. I feel that it's very important on both a professional, and more importantly, a personal level. And it's very strongly how I feel about the relationships I have: that not only should I treat others how I want to be treated, but that I should treat them in a way that I would treat them if I were in the limelight and being analyzed by the rest of the world. So basically, don't live by the golden rule, live like the world is watching your every move. And don't say or do things you wouldn't want to be held accountable for at a later time. I think I put it on the board in my office because I was having a particularly bad day of nasty text messages from my ex and I wanted to remind myself to remain cool, calm, and collected. But it's still a philosophy I try to uphold on a daily basis anyway. "
+17069923021,"Aug 9, 2014 4:06 PM",Yes,"I like it. I have something similar that I've tried to hold myself to since my last year in highschool. Back when I was making ""character adjustments"" How's Vegas?"
+12103557887,"Aug 9, 2014 4:09 PM",No,Hot haha
+12103557887,"Aug 9, 2014 4:09 PM",No,It's alright
+17069923021,"Aug 9, 2014 4:34 PM",Yes,Just alright? You're not doing anything fun?
+12103557887,"Aug 9, 2014 4:36 PM",No,Haha oh I dunno. There's a lot of rough stuff going on with the kids and their Dad right now so I'm kind of distracted. I've done a lot of exploring along the strip though. So that's been good. 
+17069923021,"Aug 9, 2014 7:01 PM",Yes,Well I hope you end up having some fun. And take pictures! =P

+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 1:05 PM",No,"Haha because it's Perry? Or because it's called ""Smart Rinse""? "
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 1:07 PM",Yes,Haha the Phineas and Ferb cover. I didn't even realize it said smart rinse. But yeah that too lol.

+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 1:07 PM",No,"But no, I don't use it "
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,So how long are you gone for?
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 1:33 PM",No,I got back last night. It was an horrible trip. Shouldn't have gone. I wasn't able to enjoy any of the time at all because of the usual ex drama. I think he knew I was going on a trip and decided he wanted to ruin it for me. As silly as that sounds. 
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 1:35 PM",No,But he's done it before. Multiple times. 
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 1:50 PM",Yes,I'm so sorry. That's awful.
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 1:51 PM",No,It's life. But thanks for saying so anyway. 
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 2:19 PM",Yes,"I feel weird sometimes sharing verses. But I thought maybe you'd find some encouragement in this. James 1:2-4 talks about looking for joy in the trials we face because our perseverance through them is what makes us a more complete person. I don't think that is solely just for the sake of developing oneself. I believe as a person who has endured certain struggles in life, you have the ability to guide others facing similar issues. That's where the joy comes from in the end; from being able to use your negatives to be a positive in someone else's life. Sorry if that's a little cliché. But I figured I'd throw some seeds out anyway."
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 3:04 PM",No,Clichés are often very applicable to real life though. And thanks for sharing with me. I don't often talk about that stuff with people either. 
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:42 PM",Yes,I don't find it as a plot hole. But I've heard quite a few people view the lack of assistance from the eagles as a plot hole.
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:43 PM",Yes,And the text I was reading was explaining why it didn't make sense for the eagles to help.
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:44 PM",Yes,"They're a strong proud sentient race, who don't need no wizard."
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:44 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 5:47 PM",No,"Gotcha. I don't see their lack of assistance as a plot hole. There were many creatures and beings in Middle Earth who didn't assist in the quest to destroy the One Ring. Why didn't the Maia help for that matter? Or Tom Bombadil? He's more of a plot hole than the Eagles. The Eagles served Tolkien's purpose perfectly, in my opinion. They just get on my nerves a bit with their constant swooping in to save the day and all haha. If anything, they're too prideful and want all of the glory for themselves lol"
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:48 PM",Yes,Exactly.
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 5:47 PM",No,Was that what the article was saying? Haha
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 5:54 PM",Yes,Pretty much. Carrying the gang would have been lowly. Plus they have.... eagle things to attend to lol.
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 5:53 PM",No,Definitely. Makes sense. 
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 5:57 PM",No,"I don't remember exactly where, maybe in his letters, but I recall Tolkien addressing the role of the Eagles in his stories and why the ""plot hole"" is problematic for some people. "
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 5:59 PM",No,"If you don't mind me asking, why did you say you needed to pick your jaw up off the ground? "
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 6:01 PM",Yes,It was a bit of an exaggeration of course. But your comment was was a perspective I'd never heard before and I found my jaw hanging a couple times due to my intrigue.
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 6:02 PM",Yes,"You have experienced this before, no? lol"
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:02 PM",No,Yes haha I just didn't know what you meant

+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:04 PM",No,I don't think I've ever gone that far before lol
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 6:08 PM",Yes,In the past it has usually only happened while reading about a programming practice or style dealing with data manipulation. There's my hyper nerd showing. I just get so entranced everything else shuts down haha.
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:09 PM",No,Except for the salivary glands? Hahaha 
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 6:10 PM",Yes,Maybe my parents performed Pavlovian experiments on me as a child.
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:10 PM",No,Hahahaha I was just talking about Pavlov the other day
+17069923021,"Aug 12, 2014 6:11 PM",Yes,Oh really now? What was the context?
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:13 PM",No,"Well, that's not as funny... It had to do with the fact that for the last three months every time my kids have been with their Dad, he takes Caeden to the ER or Urgent Care. Almost like he's bring trained to have ""asthma attacks"" only when he's with his Dad.  "
+12103557887,"Aug 12, 2014 6:32 PM",No,To show that he's only taken care of by him and not by me. 
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 12:45 PM",Yes,Is anything wrong when he takes him?
+12103557887,"Aug 13, 2014 1:01 PM",No,"No. They can't figure out what's causing the attacks. And he takes him to a different place every time, so there's no patient history anywhere he goes. His pediatrician, who I've taken him to on my own twice, and his counselor, who I take him to, both agree that it's stress related and that he seems to be having anxiety attacks. But his Dad doesn't want to believe that he's causing the stress, he spends the entire weekend talking crap about me with the kids and then turns it around saying that I'm the cause of the stress even though Caeden doesn't have these attacks when he's with me. It's a big mess. "
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 6:42 PM",Yes,Is he rough with the kids? Mentally I mean.
+12103557887,"Aug 13, 2014 6:42 PM",No,Yes. Very. 
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,Sorry I somehow manage to keep wandering into this topic.  I just get concerned after you mention things. On the topic of conditioning though. I think it would be fun to condition a roommate. I haven't really had that opportunity lol.
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,Maybe I can room with Kris. And I'll perform experiments on him.
+12103557887,"Aug 13, 2014 6:57 PM",No,"Don't be concerned. It's an unfortunate circumstance, but it'll work out the way it's supposed to in the end. \LF\LFHow would you condition Kris? Haha and to do what? "
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 7:01 PM",Yes,The easiest one would just condition him to expect something when a sound is played. Like a piece of his favourite candy. The classic Pavlov. Or play a certain song and then chase him with a squirt bottle.
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 7:01 PM",Yes,Do every other day or so for a few months. Then stop for a while and play the song to see if he reacts.
+17069923021,"Aug 13, 2014 7:02 PM",Yes,Kinda terrible. But it would be fun to try.
+12103557887,"Aug 13, 2014 7:02 PM",No,Yeah that would be kind of horrible haha

+12103557887,"Aug 20, 2014 12:12 PM",No,That's why I thought it was bubble mint. Yeah it's minty. But bubblegum-minty. If that makes sense.

+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 1:44 PM",Yes,Haha gum stresses me out unless it's mint. I'm conflicted. It's bubble gum... But it's minty.

+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 1:59 PM",Yes,I didn't hear much about that one.
+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 1:59 PM",Yes,What was it even about
+12103557887,"Aug 20, 2014 2:00 PM",No,How people die in the Wild West. It was a raunchy comedy that I got dragged along to with a group of friends. Written by Seth McFarlane who does Family Guy. 
+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 2:02 PM",Yes,That doesn't sound like it has much of a story.
+12103557887,"Aug 20, 2014 2:03 PM",No,"Like I said, it was stupid Hahahaha "

+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 2:11 PM",Yes,Prolly later in the day. Are you working that day? Or do you still have Fridays off?

+17069923021,"Aug 20, 2014 2:39 PM",Yes,Would you like some help?
+12103557887,"Aug 20, 2014 2:41 PM",No,Hmmm maybe. I'll see what the day is looking like and let you know. Is that okay?

+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,It's pretty intense. It's like a peppermint.
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,I'm not sure why but I'm kinda sensitive to it. Makes me want to sneeze and cry lol.

+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:03 PM",No,Yeeeeeahhhhh....no
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:03 PM",No,I'd be excited if I still didn't have to pack everything hahaha
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:03 PM",No,It's gonna be a long night
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 9:05 PM",Yes,Do you drink much caffeine?
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:05 PM",No,Nope. None at all. 
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:05 PM",No,I muscle through it with no additives bahahaha
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 9:09 PM",Yes,Your gonna live to be like 300 years old.

+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 9:12 PM",Yes,I wonder why.
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:12 PM",No,Procreation happened more and more and people didn't need to live as long to keep the species going. 
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:13 PM",No,That would be my guess anyway. 
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 9:15 PM",Yes,That's actually a really impressive theory. Wow
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:18 PM",No,"You think? That was spur of the moment, hadn't ever even considered the matter before. "
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 9:31 PM",Yes,"Well it wasn't just a lame answer like, ""technology has made us rely less on ourselves for survival"". Idk it seemed like it was actually insightful."
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:32 PM",No,Hahahaha I was thinking about how Sarah had Isaac when she was like 90 and that's how I came up with the procreation thing
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 9:35 PM",No,My thought process is strange 
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,Wow they were old. Haha but that was clever. I enjoy hearing the reasoning behind your decisions and thoughts.
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,Are you still packing?
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Yup. Pulling my first all night we since grad school haha

+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Stupid phone 
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,"Today I asked Siri where I could buy a pizza stone and she replied with, ""I'm sorry Michael, but cant search for restaurants in Tanzania."""
+17069923021,"Aug 21, 2014 11:24 PM",Yes,iPhones are weird
+12103557887,"Aug 21, 2014 11:24 PM",No,Hahaha oh Siri. 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 12:12 AM",Yes,I hope your able to get some rest tonight. I'm about to pass out early. Goodnight =)
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 9:38 AM",No,"Didn't see your message till after 1 and I didn't want to wake you. I did get some rest, yes, but now it's right back to packing! Have a good day"
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 3:09 PM",Yes,You too. May your day of moving be productive. And stay hydrated. It's like a furnace out there.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 3:21 PM",No,Yeah I'm super thirsty right now haha
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 7:56 PM",Yes,Are you still going at it?
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 7:59 PM",No,Yeah. I had to leave for three hours for a meet the teacher thing and nothing got done during that time. 
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 8:01 PM",No,My mom was supposed to be getting stuff done and she took a nap instead. 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,lol
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 8:02 PM",Yes,Is everything moved? Or do you still have stuff to transfer.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 8:01 PM",No,It's not even all packed yet. That's what she said she would help with. Didn't happen though. Sigh. 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,Maybe she got exhausted just looking at stuff. So it's looking like I'll be sharing an apartment with Kris in the near future. So I'll be having to do the packing thing too.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 8:08 PM",No,Oh yeah? At the same place?
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,Does your mom work?
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 8:08 PM",Yes,Yeah at the same complex.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 8:08 PM",No,"Well that's not too bad then. And no, she doesn't work at all. Hasn't had a job in years. And she's got no health problems either. Hence the sigh on my part. "
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,Yeah it's the only way I can break my lease; by transferring.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 9:54 PM",No,Gotcha
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,Wow you're fast
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 9:55 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 9:59 PM",No,Fast at what? Responding? 
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:00 PM",No,My phone's in my pocket and if my hands aren't full I'll answer. Haha
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:00 PM",Yes,Well getting my shift taken care of ended up being a bigger task than expected. I asked every single hardlines TM and cashiers and etc. everyone is working today. =( I so wanted to see guardians tonight. I think I'm gonna go Sunday.
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:01 PM",Yes,Haha yeah. I felt like I had just pressed send.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:01 PM",No,Oh haha you might have 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:14 PM",Yes,Thinking about asking Kris and Matt. Would you like to go?
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:14 PM",No,I'll have the kids again at 2. They start school Monday. 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,Ah yeah that's right.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:22 PM",No,Yeah. 
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:22 PM",No,Crazy weekend 
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:37 PM",Yes,You can text that again.
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Crazy weekend
+17069923021,"Aug 22, 2014 10:37 PM",Yes,=P
+12103557887,"Aug 22, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Ha
+17069923021,"Aug 26, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,Did the kiddos have an awesome first day at the new school?
+12103557887,"Aug 26, 2014 1:32 PM",No,"Kailani did, but she's very social and makes friends easily. Caeden will have a harder time getting used to the new environment. And he's really shy and doesn't make friends quickly, so the transition will take some time for him. "
+17069923021,"Aug 26, 2014 2:50 PM",Yes,"I always had issues making friends in school too. Eventually the people that have the most trouble drift towards each other though I think. My friends husband told me he used to do this thing to help him make friends. He would carry around some sort of prop. Like a Rubik's cube or some other intriguing/strange object. Occasionally people will initiate an interaction to question you about it. Then you don't have to be the one to initiate a conversation with a stranger. I've kinda adopted it at work and university. I'll either carry my cube around, another puzzle, or my poi. And started to look for other people who carry their own props too; whether they're doing it purposefully or not. And I'll ask them about it. It's kind of a weird tactic for making friends but it's worked out for me often enough to warrant sharing it."
+12103557887,"Aug 26, 2014 2:51 PM",No,I'll see if he wants to do something like that. He's definitely a different kid though and might not even want to have people talking to him anyway. 
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,I accidentally make up a word today: Forsuretainly. It somehow stumbled out of my mouth while on the phone with a guest.
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:42 PM",No,"That's close enough to ""for certainly"" and might have still made sense haha"
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,Yeah I think she got it lol.
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:49 PM",No,Made up words are fun
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:50 PM",Yes,Oh forsuretainly.
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:50 PM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,"Haha I didn't even have to type that. I started typing ""fors"" and my phone finished it."
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:52 PM",No,Uh-oh. You've got autocorrect on your brain waves already huh? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,Yup lol. How's your marathon going? Are you guys still at it?
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:55 PM",No,We're on the Deathly Hallows part 2 now. About 45 minutes left and we're all done. Unfortunately. 
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 8:56 PM",Yes,O_O!! When did you start??
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 8:58 PM",No,Monday. We were doing one a day and then did three today. Haha
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,Oooh. I for some reason assumed you had started today.
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 9:00 PM",No,Oh haha no. That would be crazy!
+17069923021,"Aug 30, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,Well enjoy your movie night! =) 
+12103557887,"Aug 30, 2014 9:12 PM",No,Oh we are! Haha
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:32 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:33 PM",No,Did you pick it up?!!!!!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:34 PM",Yes,no lol. So scary! 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:34 PM",Yes,I don't want to hurt it. It's so little.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:33 PM",No,How is that scary? It's a moth. 
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:33 PM",No,It looks huge haha
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:33 PM",No,Just don't touch the wings
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:34 PM",Yes,I got my camera really close.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:35 PM",No,Oh haha
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:36 PM",No,It looks like it's got a lion's mane. Too cool!
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:36 PM",No,You found a Simba moth!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:39 PM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:41 PM",Yes,Is he gonna freak out if I shine my softbox on him?
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:42 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:42 PM",No,He IS tiny!
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:42 PM",No,No he won't freak out. They stop flying when they're tired. He'll only stay there for a couple days to regain energy and then be on his way again. 
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:44 PM",No,He's got the coolest fuzzy legs!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:44 PM",Yes,Uh he's vibrating.. Help?
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:45 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:46 PM",No,Hahahahaha 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:47 PM",Yes,Oh Lordy. Um.. He just took off... In my apartment. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:47 PM",Yes,Um.. I guess no photoshoot then.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:46 PM",No,That just means he's nervous lol
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:48 PM",No,Hahahahaha 
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:48 PM",No,You took him inside?! Serves you right lol
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:49 PM",Yes,Accidental pet number 3. I wanted to photograph him with a controllable lighting environment. =(
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:51 PM",No,Haha oh well. He'll get out eventually. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:52 PM",Yes,!! Found him. Come're Muffin! ￼
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:54 PM",No,His name is Muffin?! Oh Lordy. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 12:56 PM",Yes,I felt it suited him. lol
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 12:57 PM",No,So is he a girl now? 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:01 PM",Yes,"I think in the realm of animals, Muffin is a rather gender neutral name. That being said, I'm not sure what alliance he/she is aligned to. Maybe I should pick up an entomology class. lol"
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:11 PM",No,Muffin is totally a girl's name!!!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:12 PM",Yes,Ooh this one focused really nicely. ￼
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:12 PM",Yes,What?? Male animals can totally go as Muffin. What are you talking about?
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:13 PM",Yes,Like a boy kitty.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:16 PM",No,"Sorry, it's three against one here. Both the kids and myself say Muffin is a girl name.  "
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:18 PM",No,You are hilarious 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:21 PM",Yes,Haha that's not fair!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,He likes his name. Don't take that away from him lol. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:23 PM",Yes,He confided in me while he was vibrating like a furry toothbrush. He said everyone makes fun of his name at moth school. But he likes it.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:23 PM",No,"It's totally fair! If I've got a populace to poll, I'm gonna get a result. And I was very fair about the question being polled. ""Is Muffin a boy or a girl name."" The results were unanimous. "
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:24 PM",Yes,Wait wait. Did you specify for Animals? It has to be limited to animals. I demand a recount.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:24 PM",No,"Kailani says ""I feel like crying that's so funny. He can keep his name if he's wants, but it's still a girl's name."""
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:24 PM",No,It WAS limited to animals!
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:25 PM",No,Don't pull a Florida on me just because you don't like the results!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:25 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:30 PM",No,"Caeden says he can ""talk bug. And according to calculations, moths like muffins, so the moth would like the name muffin."""
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:31 PM",Yes,See! Totally gender neutral name. That's a smart kid right there.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:32 PM",No,"Caeden says ""thank you."" Hahaha"
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:33 PM",No,"But, all he said was that since moths LIKE muffins, he'd be okay with the name muffin. It's still not a gender neutral name lol"
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:33 PM",No,"Awww what?! My troops have turned against me. Florida wins this round. After a re-polling, the general population agrees that Muffin can be used for either a girl or a boy. I've been betrayed!"
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:34 PM",Yes,Bwuahahaha.
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:35 PM",Yes,*high fives all around*
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:35 PM",No,They're high fiving the air. I'm pretending that I'm not being offered a high five at all. Hmphf. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:39 PM",Yes,I'm high fiving the air too haha.
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:39 PM",Yes,"Aww, You can have a high five from me too of you're feeling left out lol."
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:40 PM",No,I'm not feeling left out. I'm ungracefully accepting defeat. 
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:40 PM",No,Being a sore loser. 
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:40 PM",No,I thought I had it in the bag!
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 1:50 PM",Yes,"I thought you did too. But when people search their heart, they find the truth. The truth that animals should be able to live in a world where they aren't looked down upon because of their human-parent-given name. A world where a male Labrador names Goosie MsFluffers can grow up to be a successful businessdog. That is the world I dream of."
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 1:50 PM",No,"Hahahaha oh Andrew, we need to hang out again soon, I've missed your goofiness"
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 2:06 PM",Yes,=D I fully agree. It's been too long.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 2:07 PM",No,"It's been one heck of a summer. I'm thankful it's kind of winding down a bit. Still moving in, but I can slowly see progress on that front. "
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 2:50 PM",Yes,Has everything been transferred to your new place already?
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 3:05 PM",No,Mostly. But not completely. Just a few things left at my mom's. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 3:07 PM",Yes,Kris and I are moving in on the 28th of Sept. And then Matt and Sarah are moving Friday of the same week. We're both relocating in the same complex lol.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 3:08 PM",No,So you're in for about as much fun as I had. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 3:25 PM",Yes,Yup lol. Save I don't have to travel as far.
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 3:27 PM",Yes,Did you ever get around to seeing Guardians of the Galaxy?
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 3:32 PM",No,No I still haven't seen it. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 4:26 PM",Yes,Well that needs to be fixed lol.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 4:26 PM",No,Yeah I know! It's just been too crazy to go yet. 
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 4:29 PM",Yes,Well I haven't seen it either haha. Everyone is always working on the days I plan to see it.
+17069923021,"Aug 31, 2014 4:30 PM",Yes,Almost went by myself last week.
+12103557887,"Aug 31, 2014 5:06 PM",No,I'd still like to go. Eventually haha
+17069923021,"Sep 1, 2014 1:14 PM",Yes,Are you still typically free on Thursdays and Fridays?
+12103557887,"Sep 1, 2014 2:01 PM",No,"When the kids are with Joe, yes. They go to him this weekend. "
+12103557887,"Sep 1, 2014 2:45 PM",No,But whenever they're with him I'm free Thursday through Sunday. Except Friday during work of course. 
+12103557887,"Sep 1, 2014 4:38 PM",No,It would work for him though. 
+12103557887,"Sep 1, 2014 4:41 PM",No,"￼This is a ""Muffin"" cat. But his name is Charlie. "
+17069923021,"Sep 1, 2014 4:52 PM",Yes,Hmm maybe Thursday or Sunday. Those are the days I'm usually free. And I didn't really understand. Theyre with him this weekend starting Thursday? Or starting on the weekend.
+17069923021,"Sep 1, 2014 4:53 PM",Yes,That cat is amazing. His expression.
+17069923021,"Sep 1, 2014 5:11 PM",Yes,I'm also wondering if you were aware of the slight irony in the recount due to the fact that I am legally a Florida resident.
+12103557887,"Sep 1, 2014 5:58 PM",No,"They're with him this weekend, and every other weekend from now until Caeden is 18. Or, eternity, in my eyes. And their weekends with him start on Thursdays at 7.  \LF\LFCharlie is hilarious. He's huge. Like, really really huge. Like 25 pounds huge. He's just abnormally large. \LF\LFAnd naturally I did the Florida thing on purpose knowing you're from there. I pay attention. And it worked both ways...politically and for you specifically. The double meaning was completely planned. \LF"
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,"=/ That sounds tough. Is that like a legal arrangement? or just an agreement. If you don't mind me asking. I'm not too familiar with things of this nature.\LF\LFHe's quite a lovely cat. I can't even begin to explain how much I love cats. They are wonderful, and fluffy and have different personalities. I love they're tongues and their tails and their movement. Even if I grew up old and alone I would be alright it had a dozen cats at my side lol."
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 1:24 PM",No,"It will be the legal arrangement once the papers are signed. He's requested expanded visitation rights which is Thursday night through Monday morning. Right now it's just what I've agreed to do for him. He's supposed to see them every week on Thursdays, but he chooses to only see them every other week instead. "
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 1:25 PM",No,I'm a fan of cats too. I've had a few over the years. 
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 6:22 PM",Yes,Would you be up for seeing it Thursday or Sunday by chance? I think Kris wants to see it too.
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 6:50 PM",No,Yeah I'm down for that. Sunday might be better though since Thursday would probably be too late for me with work on Friday morning and all. 
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,Sunday sounds good. =D
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 8:22 PM",No,Awesome! Have you found a home church yet? 
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 8:45 PM",Yes,I haven't. =\ what about you. Any luck?
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 8:50 PM",No,"I haven't really been looking as much as I'd like. But now that I'm getting settled in, I'm gonna start back on that. There's a church called Crossbridge that my mom was encouraging me to try. So I may try there this weekend. "
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 8:57 PM",Yes,Is it near where you live? My trainee told me they hold service at the movie theatre across the street from me. I've been meaning to try it out.
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 8:57 PM",No,It's off of 1604. Not exactly sure where. I can find out. It's probably closer to me than you though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 9:02 PM",Yes,There's a place up 35 I used to go when I first moved here. Crosspoint I think it's called? I really liked the preacher there. But never met anybody there. So I felt really distant from everyone.
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 9:03 PM",No,"I'm not sure if it's the same place. This one is definitely Crossbridge, that's all I know about it. "
+17069923021,"Sep 2, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,No I'm pretty sure it's a different one. It was north 35 outside the 1604 loop. Up in Selma where I used to live.
+12103557887,"Sep 2, 2014 9:08 PM",No,Yeah that's probably a different one haha
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 2:30 PM",No,"Okay, so Crossbridge is totally not on 1604. I don't know what my mom was telling me. It's on 281 North near Spring Branch. Hah way too far. "
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 3:45 PM",Yes,So not going? Aw. I challenge you to find another one near you. I'm set on going to the one near me.
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 3:45 PM",No,The movie theater one? 
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 5:23 PM",Yes,Mmhmm. I'm just hoping it's not a bunch of stereotypical college kids. =\
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 5:25 PM",Yes,From what I was told it's geared towards students.
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 6:47 PM",No,"I don't know that I'd enjoy that type of a church. I feel like it would seem rather disconnected to me. Hopefully it works for you though, I know you've been wanting to find the right fit for a while. "
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 8:34 PM",Yes,You've got a point. The turnover is prolly pretty high. And with only one semester left it's going to be hard to build a relationship with people there. =\ I still need to go somewhere though. I'd like to end up somewhere that's got all kinds of people; not specifically geared towards a specific age group or singles or whatnot.
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 8:41 PM",No,"Yeah, I think diversity is key. "
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 8:41 PM",No,"You say ""one semester left"", does that mean you're only here till December? "
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 8:42 PM",Yes,I need to double check with my advisor but I'm set to graduate in December. Don't worry I'm not leaving anytime soon though.
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 8:43 PM",No,I knew you were planning on graduating then. I was just wondering why you'd be moving in with Kris if you were leaving in December haha
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 8:44 PM",No,"Sorry, I'm slightly distracted, doing laundry and watching the LEGO movie at the same time. "
+17069923021,"Sep 3, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,"Yup not leaving. I've made some pretty sweet friends, including you. I'm just not ready yet. Someday I'll head up north.\LF\LFOh that's such a great movie. SPACESHIP!!!"
+12103557887,"Sep 3, 2014 9:06 PM",No,"Am I a sweet friend? Hahaha I don't think I'm all that cool. \LF\LFAnd yeah, it's a fun movie. 🎶DARKNESS! NO PARENTS! MORE DARKESS!🎶"
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 12:41 PM",Yes,Don't sell yourself short. Yes you're an awesome friend. Definitely one of my favourite humans.
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 12:48 PM",No,Aw thanks Andrew!
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 12:55 PM",Yes,"There was a service dog that ""relieved himself"" in A block last night. It wasn't very pleasant. Luckily I was on break when the actual event occurred."
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 12:56 PM",Yes,Pardon the drastic conversation topic change.
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 1:03 PM",Yes,I'm looking into USAA for work. Reggie keeps telling me I should get a job at Rackspace. I just feel like Rackspace would be less related to what I studied for. I want to effectively utilize what I shed blood and tears over you know? lol. If I do end up in Seattle(which I definitely would not mind) there's a software company called Logos there that's been around for quite a while. They make software for bible study. Seemed like an interesting job.
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 1:29 PM",No,"That sucks about the dog excrement. But it's good you didn't have to help with that. That's never cool. Even when it's your own dog. \LF\LFWhen are you wanting to start looking for a full time thing? Would your school schedule allow for something now? I don't see any reason why exploring options through Rackspace would be a completely bad thing. For that matter you might want to look at several different options for work down here. Even the school districts here have positions that you could qualify for in the data processing departments and such. You'd probably be able to find something in a very non-conventional place that you'd be pretty happy with. \LF\LFSeattle is lovely, but the cost of living there is more than exhorbitant! My cousin just bought a house in north Seattle for $400,000. It's a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath, no garage, and only 1,100 square feet. Yikes! You'd probably need to live in a suburb and commute, but then there's the cost of sitting in traffic for five hours a day haha. \LF\LFI don't know exactly where I want to end up. In the northwest, I'm sure. I just don't know exactly where or when. "
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 1:40 PM",Yes,"Chances are I couldn't work anything full time out with school. Unless they would let me leave at odd times during the day for class; which isn't too far fetched I guess. Just depends on the job. I do need to start looking though. Even if I can't start immediately.\LF\LFHow would I go about looking for a job with the school district? Just even to see what kinds of things are a available.\LF\LFMy my. Yeah I had assumed that it would be fairly high. I wouldn't be planning on living directly IN the city. Actually, I think Logos is located on the outskirts."
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 1:42 PM",Yes,￼Also I just got to the best part.(I've had a few extended holidays from reading)
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 1:47 PM",No,"That's certainly the best part! \LF\LFI'd save the job search until October to be sure that you've got the time to finish the semester strong. And you probably wouldn't be able to find a position that would let you leave whenever for class. \LF\LFYou can look on the school districts' web sites for job postings. Also, I'd look on monster.com for jobs. Have you started on a resume yet? \LF\LFThe outskirts of Seattle are still really nice! But yeah, IN the city is super pricey. "
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 1:58 PM",No,www.neisd.net/HR/Applicants/Positions_Available.html\LF\LFThat's where the job listings are with my district. Every district should have a similar page. 
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 4:18 PM",Yes,"My résumé needs some work. I haven't worked on it since I applied to Target. But I definitely have some stuff to put on it now.\LF\LFAnd thank you. =) I will take look at that. I'm assuming I can just google the school districts in the area. It may be hard to believe, but I'm not too familIar with the schools here haha."
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 4:20 PM",No,"It's not hard to believe at all. The only two districts I would really recommend would be NEISD and Northside ISD (NISD) though. And if you need help with editing your resume, just let me know. I've got some practice with that. Mine's pretty okay if I do say so myself haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 4, 2014 7:13 PM",Yes,I was being just a tad facetious lol. See? Offering to help me? You are a sweet friend!
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 7:42 PM",No,Haha the facetiousness was totally lost on me lol
+12103557887,"Sep 4, 2014 7:49 PM",No,And I always help friends out when I can. So I guess I don't see it as sweet. It's just me being me.  
+17069923021,"Sep 5, 2014 12:59 PM",Yes,Not all friends willingly offer time without being asked. So yeah lol. So that mean you're a good friend. Do you have a preceded theatre? I think it's still showing pretty much everywhere.
+12103557887,"Sep 5, 2014 1:03 PM",No,"I not only offer help, I actually follow through with the help too haha. I'm not a fan of fake helpers; people who say they'll do something and then ""forget"" or ""have a conflict"". That's just so disingenuous. It makes me sad. \LF\LFAnd as far as a preferred theater goes, maybe Huebner Oaks? It's about halfway between us, I'd guess. "
+17069923021,"Sep 5, 2014 1:34 PM",Yes,"I'm not sure why people do that. Not necessarily with just helping either. I've had friends that agreed to hang out on a particular day and bail for something else. I mean, I completely understand if an important issue arises, but stuff like going to hang out with another friend instead. At least let me know ahead of time right? When you purposely set aside time for them only for them to not show up it doesn't feel so great. Hmm I might have gone on a bit of a long tangent there.\LF\LFSo haha it's showing at 230, 7, and 730. At HueOaks. Right now Kris and I are for sure going. Matt, Reggie, and Jerry are possibles because I think they've all already see it, but are up for a second viewing.\LF\LFWhat was your plan for the day? Were you just planning on the movie? Or would you like to grab some dinner and play games too?"
+17069923021,"Sep 5, 2014 1:35 PM",Yes,"Also, and this is a very important, I don't recall asking you this before so my apologies if I have. What is your stance on the Oxford comma?"
+12103557887,"Sep 5, 2014 2:46 PM",No,"I agree. Friends should notify you if plans change. I think I've only ever cancelled plans three times in my entire life and they were all for legitimate reasons. I've never cancelled plans with one person just to do something with someone else. That's rude. \LF\LFI don't have a set plan for the day yet. If you wanted to see the 2:30 so that we can eat and play games in the evening, I'd be totally down for that. Just as long as I can get my old lady self in bed by 10:30 or so. \LF\LFI use commas to denote a pause. When I write, I consider how the material is being read aloud as well. So this often means I use a fair amount of commas and other sorts of punctuation to ""help my reader"" gain a sense of my voice. So I suppose you'd say I'm for the use of a serial comma. You? "
+17069923021,"Sep 5, 2014 6:28 PM",Yes,You're too funny. I'll make sure to send you to bed in time for you to get a good night's sleep. Ok 230 sounds good to Kris and I too. Have you ever been to Johnny Carino's? I got a coupon for it a while back ago in case we end up trying it out. And I am definitely pro serial comma.
+12103557887,"Sep 5, 2014 6:30 PM",No,Yeah I've been there once. It's not bad at all. 2:30 it is then!
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 2:07 PM",Yes,￼Its like my doorstep is the new hangout zone.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 2:09 PM",No,I love when that happens! 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 2:09 PM",No,I haven't had any at my new place yet. 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:15 PM",Yes,He was still there when I got back from lunch. I just picked him up. Omigosh. My heart is racing.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:15 PM",No,Hahahaha why?
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:18 PM",Yes,I am not a huge fan of bugs. The only other bug that I will willingly pick up is an ant lion. And those are tiny! This thing was big!
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:18 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:18 PM",No,How big?
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:18 PM",Yes,That big
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:18 PM",No,Ahhhhhh! Yasssss!!!! So cool! 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:23 PM",No,Try not to think of them as bugs. Think of them as small wingéd creatures. (The accent is there to place stress on the second syllable.)
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:24 PM",Yes,That is definitely how I pronounced it when I saw it.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:24 PM",No,Hahaha good
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:26 PM",Yes,I like the other one better. I mean this one was cool cause it was big. But the other one was a fuzz ball. And the antennae were so pretty.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:26 PM",No,The antennae make all the difference!
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:28 PM",No,You've seen photos of the one I caught right? His antennae were fantastic! 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:29 PM",Yes,The one in your office right?
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:30 PM",No,Yessir
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:30 PM",No,￼
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:31 PM",Yes,I went back and looked it up on your Instagram lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:31 PM",No,Yeah I saw hahah
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:32 PM",Yes,So magnificent!
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:32 PM",No,He was huge!
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:32 PM",No,My favorite one ever!
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:32 PM",No,I kind of have a things for picking up bugs that I know won't harm me.

+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 3:44 PM",Yes,"I did! But I couldn't remember what so I said ""formerly""."
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 3:43 PM",No,Or was that just to keep me quiet?

+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 4:04 PM",Yes,"That's one of my fave things about you. It's refreshing to know someone who cares about words. I don't make many friends who posses that. I think I might have mentioned my sister in law to you before, but you would love her lol. She's a wordbender too! Lol\LF\LFAnd no I just knew exactly how to get to it. It's one of my favourite comics by xkcd, the artist."

+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:13 PM",No,Because I wanted to get the clothes unpacked and put away first. I worked on the upstairs and this week I'll be working on the downstairs. The bookcases will all be downstairs. 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:14 PM",No,I had method! Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:14 PM",No,*a method
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,Yeah closet stuff is always the stuff I do first. When I have the choice to at least. In majority of my moves I was not present when my things were packed. Quite often everybody was a surprise when I finally unpacked them.
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,Stuff that has multiple possible locations should go last.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:17 PM",No,Fortunately most of my things were still boxed from when I moved them out of my old house. So that helped. 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:18 PM",No,I'm hoping to be fully moved in and ready to go by next weekend. But I have a feeling it'll end up taking longer than that. Sigh. 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:19 PM",Yes,Lol. It's ok. I still have a box that I never unpacked.

+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,"Yup, this is gonna be fun."
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,Kinda half sarcasm there. But I am actually excited about it too.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:22 PM",No,Is Kris your first roommate?
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:23 PM",Yes,Yes.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:22 PM",No,I never had a real roommate. I feel like I kind of missed out on a lot of important steps during my transition to adult life haha
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:28 PM",Yes,I'm not really benefitting from it. I figured it would be a good learning experience for me; learning how to live with someone. My mom was telling me the same thing the other day. She went from living at home with her parents to living with my dad after they got married. 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:29 PM",No,Yeah. That's all I've ever known. Family or different family. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:32 PM",Yes,Well you got a couple of little roommates. I'm hoping I don't want to murder Kris by next summer.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:33 PM",No,Hahaha kids aren't roommates. I get to boss them around. \LF\LFJust have clear house rules you both agree on and stick to those rules. 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,Are you trying any services out tomorrow?
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:36 PM",No,I haven't decided yet. My mom got really upset when I said I didn't think I wanted to try Crossbridge. She took it as a personal offense. Unfortunately. So I may go to their 11:00 just to appease her. 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:38 PM",Yes,"Well at least your going somewhere. Hey, it might be a swell place."
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:38 PM",No,I don't know. We'll see.

+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:42 PM",No,It's up to you. I can do either way. 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:44 PM",Yes,Haha. Well I meant we could meet you there or you could come to my apartment and ride with us.
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:45 PM",No,I know what you meant haha
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:45 PM",No,Why don't I see what's going on in the morning and I'll let you know. Is that fine? 
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,I was just confused cause that seemed like a choice that more concerned your preference rather than mine lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:48 PM",Yes,Yeah that's fine lol
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:48 PM",No,Yeah I know hahaha I do that sometimes 
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:48 PM",No,"Deflect and to see what other people would prefer more, even when it should be focused on my preference. Sorry. "
+17069923021,"Sep 6, 2014 9:56 PM",Yes,"There 3 choices with three factors at play. Riding together would be fun but would require you to leave earlier, we could meet halfway and you leave your car to for optimal collective gas usage. Or we just meet and and you follow us back. Which is boring lol."
+12103557887,"Sep 6, 2014 9:57 PM",No,Hahahaha I'll decide tomorrow lol keep you guessing
+12103557887,"Sep 7, 2014 1:03 PM",No,I'll leave here in 30 and head to your place. That should give us enough time right?
+17069923021,"Sep 7, 2014 1:14 PM",Yes,I would imagine so. You've still got your mental map to my place no? Also don't text me if you're driving. *glare* lol
+12103557887,"Sep 7, 2014 1:14 PM",No,Hahaha I'm not driving! I'm at my place!
+12103557887,"Sep 7, 2014 1:15 PM",No,The only thing I don't remember is the apartment number for the gate code. 
+17069923021,"Sep 7, 2014 1:19 PM",Yes,Haha I was pretty sure you hadn't left yet. It was a forewarning.
+17069923021,"Sep 7, 2014 1:19 PM",Yes,116 is the gate code
+12103557887,"Sep 7, 2014 1:20 PM",No,Well the warning has been received then lol

+17069923021,"Sep 8, 2014 9:30 AM",Yes,Oh dear haha. The part where we're planting a tree looks like we're doing a synchronized dance! Haha. I haven't laughed that hard in a while; felt good.
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 9:30 AM",No,Hahahaha we had the same idea 
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 9:30 AM",No,"Yeah, it's been a while since I've had a good hearty laugh too"

+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:28 AM",No,Yeah but I didn't want you to get freaked out
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:35 AM",No,And if we're asking those questions... What was on my face when you were looking at me on the couch? Was my mascara running from the crying? 
+17069923021,"Sep 8, 2014 10:39 AM",Yes,"nope, just creepin' lol. Looking at the details of your face. You have a nice face."
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:40 AM",No,Oh haha now I feel like I shouldn't have asked. I just get self conscious when people look at me. 
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:42 AM",No,"And you were ""creepin'""? hahaha"
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:42 AM",No,That's funny

+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:49 AM",No,And thanks. I feel like a human mirror is a good thing to have on hand. 
+17069923021,"Sep 8, 2014 10:50 AM",Yes,I thought mud would be too cliché.
+17069923021,"Sep 8, 2014 10:50 AM",Yes,Human mirror. That's a good term.
+12103557887,"Sep 8, 2014 10:49 AM",No,Mud? Hahahaha I don't know why I would have either yogurt or mud on my face but I'll be extra careful with those things in the future

+17069923021,"Sep 8, 2014 11:10 AM",Yes,Oh and a giant sharpie. Somehow it escaped from the picture. ￼My dad gave them to me cause he had a bunch of them for his soldiers. Moreso for novelty. I think I figured I would use them on my friends one day.

+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 5:21 PM",No,Hahaha I'm still sad that you got the last pair. I wanted them so bad! 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 5:21 PM",Yes,The problem is that the rolled up pantlegs werent planned. It was a result of laziness after putting my socks on.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 5:21 PM",Yes,What???
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 5:21 PM",No,But it was for a worthy cause.

+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:10 PM",No,"Hahahaha fair enough. I've got some pretty awesome socks already though, so that may be a tall order for you lol"
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:13 PM",Yes,Those are challenge words ma'am.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:13 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:13 PM",No,And you shouldn't feel responsible for the socks. If I wanted them THAT badly I wouldn't have made them an option for anyone else. 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:13 PM",No,Challenge words? Hahahaha whoops
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:23 PM",Yes,Has Target always had this affinity for foxes? I feel like there is someone in a high up place in the company that just adores foxes.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:24 PM",No,You've worked for them longer than I did haha 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:24 PM",No,I thought the socks were because of the song last year
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:25 PM",No,I don't have an answer for your salt and pepper shakers this year though
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:29 PM",Yes,"You have a point. Although even before working there, I'm going to take a risk and assume we've both shopped at Target preceding our terms there. And I don't recall wether or not they sold this much fox paraphernalia. I only started noticing it after I was recruited."
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:29 PM",Yes,Not that I'm complaining. Seeing as I love foxes.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:31 PM",No,"Hahahaha yeah, I've probably spent a fair amount of time in Targets over the years. But I've never specifically looked for foxy items, so I'm not sure if the current list of fox merchandise is any longer than in years past. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:32 PM",No,Foxes are pretty cool though. I'm a big fan of owls myself. 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:32 PM",No,And raccoons. But they can be mean. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:33 PM",Yes,Raccoons are an odd one. Why do you like them?
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:34 PM",No,They are all over the Northwest. I grew up with raccoons in the yard. So they fascinate me. Raccoon babies are the cutest. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:39 PM",Yes,I guess I just haven't had much experience with them. Only animated .gifs of them sneaking food from pets.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:41 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:40 PM",No,Oh hahaha no I used to get the bejeezus scared out of me in the middle of the night when I'd wake up and look out into the cherry trees and there would be pairs of eyes staring at me haha
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:40 PM",No,Hahahaha that's too funny!
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:42 PM",Yes,I love how he walks on his hind legs! Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:42 PM",No,Agreed Sir. Agreed.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 6:45 PM",Yes,"So you had all the cool animals growing up. And I just had (read in country bumpkin) armadillers, possums, and rattlers."
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 6:47 PM",No,"I grew up in the forest. So yes, lots of cool animals. "
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:01 PM",Yes,That almost sounds like you're an elf.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:01 PM",No,Have you seen my ears? I'm definitely part elf. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:02 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:02 PM",No,True story. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:03 PM",Yes,Any special elf abilities as a result?
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:04 PM",No,You mean other than the linguistic and scholarly abilities? 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:04 PM",No,I grew up talking to trees...
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:05 PM",Yes,Ah the wisdom and knowledge of the ancients has been granted to you.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:08 PM",No,Possibly. But I still seem to make some stupid decisions pretty often. I suppose that'd be the human part...
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:13 PM",Yes,Elves don't make stupid decisions?
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:14 PM",Yes,Every race has their flaw though.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:14 PM",Yes,Well flaws...
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:18 PM",No,"I always saw elves as incredibly wise. So decisions they made would never be stupid. Maybe prideful, but not stupid. They are a bit stuck up, but not idiotic at all. I make idiot decisions sometimes. Not always thinking through to the possible consequences of my actions. Elves are very forward thinking and hesitate to make any choice at all until they have analyzed the outcome. I'm too impulsive to be fully elvish. I'm probably only 1/64th elvish or something silly like that. But at least it's better than nothing! Hahaha"
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:25 PM",No,Wow. I can't believe I'm actually arguing this.  Hahahaha please excuse my silliness
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:27 PM",Yes,I was gonna say you might be more in the 3/37 range. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:27 PM",No,Hahahaha oh Lord
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,And elves have a long life slam too. So you'll prolly cash in on that a bit too.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:28 PM",No,That might actually be correct. I've got quite a melting pot of races running through my veins. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:28 PM",Yes,We could do the math.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Slam lol *soan
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Span
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:29 PM",No,"Naw, at the rate my family drops I definitely didn't inherit the lifespan of an elf. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:31 PM",No,That sounded somewhat morbid. Haha sorry
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:32 PM",Yes,Just a smidge lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:32 PM",Yes,Maybe you have fly in you too?
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:33 PM",No,A fly?! Gross 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,*cringe* bad joke
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:33 PM",No,There have just been quite a few deaths in my family over the last several years. I've had a lot of grief to deal with. 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:33 PM",No,Not that I should be flippant about it or anything...
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,You handle it. God allows us to endure what were suited for.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,I think that's why I haven't experienced much death in my life. I don't handle it well.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:36 PM",No,I try to handle it. I think I probably don't do as good of a job with that as I could though. 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Have you experienced death before? 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:38 PM",Yes,One of my best friends from highschool died last year in January.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,I don't know if you've ever seen her picture on a memorial service bulletin I keep on my bookcase.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:41 PM",No,"How long had it been since you'd seen her? And yeah, I saw her photo. "
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,"I couple years prior. I had talked to her a few months before it happened, when we were trying to locate her brother."
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:46 PM",Yes,He has a habit of disappearing off the face of the earth occasionally.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,Brains are pretty interesting.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:50 PM",No,I think that makes it harder. When you haven't seen someone for so long and then suddenly they're gone. I know I've had a harder time with those kinds of deaths than with  ones of people I had interacted with more recently before their passing. I had the hardest time with my cousin's death two years ago. Because I hadn't seen him in over a decade and his death was very violent and unexpected. His photo was the very first thing I posted on Instagram ever. 
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 8:53 PM",No,There also always seem to be other monumental things happening in my life at the same times that people I love die. So that makes it even harder to allow myself to process the death in the first place. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 8:59 PM",Yes,I'm sorry. I've seen his picture.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,What I tend to do is rubber band back to it. Not just her death but traumatic things in general.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 9:00 PM",No,It's okay. His death was very impactful for a great many reasons. But everything happens the way God wants it to. So I take as much comfort in that as I can. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,Having a finite mind sucks sometime.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 9:11 PM",Yes,But you're right.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 9:20 PM",Yes,There's a lot of just raw thoughts and questions that come to mind when I think about stuff like this.
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 9:22 PM",Yes,Like my friends Facebook page. Her last profile picture isn't of just her. It's her and a friend. How does he feel being in that picture. It's never going to change.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 9:25 PM",No,"I read something once that said ""If you want to know what a person values most, look at what they photograph"". I think her friend should feel valued. Because she thought him valuable enough to share with the rest of the world. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 9:25 PM",No,"And yes, brains and independent thinking can make life incredibly difficult for those of us who are deep intellectual thinkers. "
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,"Sorry, I had to call my friend back. It's his birthday today."
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 10:03 PM",No,No worries. Happy birthday to your friend. 
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 10:13 PM",Yes,"I think maybe that's true for many, not all though; the photograph thing. For instance I'm often afraid to take pictures of things or people. Maybe I just I feel like I'm imposing. Do you remember when you made that super delicious mushroom pasta? I asked you if you minded me taking a picture of the food lol. It's like I need permission to feel comfortable taking it. There are so many times I would love to take pictures of my friends but I don't."
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 10:14 PM",Yes,"Oh gosh, and you're prolly getting ready for bed. So sorry!"
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 10:20 PM",No,"I feel like if they are truly your friends, it wouldn't matter to them if you take a photo, and if it did ""matter"" in some way it would be more likely that they would want the photo to be taken. Does that make sense? When I went to Seattle with my sisters I was actually kind of hurt that I spent the whole time taking photos of them or with them, but neither of them really took any photos of me. It made me feel like my absence wouldn't have made a difference to them, even though I clearly valued their presence while we were there. Maybe it was a silly thing to get my feelings hurt over, but that's how I felt anyway. If you look at my photos I think it's pretty clear what I value, so I definitely place importance on whether or not someone wants to take a photo of me or with me. And when my friends take photos with other people and specifically not with me then I really notice it. One of my good friends is that way. He'll take photos with everyone else but if I want one with him I have to ask multiple times. And I don't like that. It makes me feel like I value him more than he values me. And that's not really okay in my opinion. "
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 10:22 PM",Yes,And I didn't mean for it to sound like I was refusing your positive words. I do agree with that for the most part. My brain just like to think of special circunstances.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 10:24 PM",No,"I probably won't be going to bed anytime soon. My brain's working a little too hard tonight. \LF\LFThere are always special circumstances. I see our conversations as nothing more than exploring multiple possibilities of thought. I never feel like you're discounting my opinion, even when you offer another point of view. In fact there have been several times that you've brought up a new way of thinking about something that I had never thought of before. And that's a good thing! "
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 10:59 PM",Yes,"I've always been afraid to take photos of or with you. When we first started getting to know each other better after you left Target I never saw many photos of you on FB or Instagram. So I kinda thought maybe you didn't like your picture taken. I decided to play it safe with that assumption. (Cause social media is of course the best way to gain insight on other people <- Sarcasm) Which is why the only things, at least that I'm aware of, that has us both in it is the sock picture and the ""popsicle video"".\LF\LFI know that feeling all to well. Could it be that your sisters thought you had grown some aversion to photos? What do you think their response would be if you just flat out asked them?\LF\LFI'm glad you feel that way about these discussions of sorts. I'm sure you can tell I am beyond careful when talking about any topic that could be volatile even in the slightest. I probably care too much about it, but on the bright side I rarely get any spec of animosity from anyone. Except that cashier from the Bandera store. But I didn't really even get a chance there. But it's nice to have an outlet for thoughts. And I trust you more than most when it comes counter points. I know that your pretty rational in your approach to things and that you at least hear out other points of view even if you don't accept it.\LF\LFBack to the topic of photos and their social influence though. I feel valued when people send me pictures of themselves or something that they experienced the day of the sending. It's the act of sharing your life with someone. And my theory is it's semi dependent on how one best processes information. For example I am a kinetic and visual learner, which directly ties to how I feel most connected to people. By seeing them and being active with them. Regarding one of my absolute best friends in high school, I would go over to his house after school most days. Sometimes I would spend 5+ hours over there in his room without either one of us uttering a single word. He'd be at his desk doing homework or games and I would be on his bed doing the same thing. But that interaction, or lack thereof would charge our friendship battery, so to speak."
+17069923021,"Sep 15, 2014 11:00 PM",Yes,Essay over.
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:02 PM",No,Hahaha and I'm a fast reader so it felt like a paragraph
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:02 PM",No,"It's not that I don't like taking photos, it's that I feel awkward posing for photos. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:04 PM",No,"And I don't see the point of selfies in today's world. I don't always like the way I look. Or rather, I feel like how I see myself in a mirror is very different from how I look in a photograph and the difference bothers me somewhat. If that makes sense at all..."
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:07 PM",No,"I don't think they feel like I don't want my photo taken. I think they were more focused on taking pictures the way they wanted to take them, which didn't really involve me. My youngest sister took nothing but selfies. Literally. And my middle sister took nothing but photos of the environment. So we all had our own set of things we wanted to capture. Maybe I went about the photographing the way I did because when I took photography the ones I enjoyed most were portraits. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:08 PM",No,"I can spend almost entire days with my kids not saying much at all, so I know what you mean about ""charging the battery,"" so to speak. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:13 PM",No,"And I try to be a good listener. I don't think there's any wrong way of thinking about things. Especially because it's all perception anyway and everyone has a completely different way of seeing the world. So I try to respect other people's opinions as much as possible. Now, if it's something which deeply offends me then I have no problem voicing that, like when my mom gets racist or my step-dad gets overly political or my sister gets preachy about things she doesn't really know about or when a friend speaks badly about a choice I make as a parent yet they have no children, but me speaking my mind generally involves me saying that I don't want to hear what they have to say on the subject and I politely exit the conversation. But that happens very rarely and always after the subject has been drawn out and quartered far too many times for me to still have patience to hear something again that I didn't want to hear originally. "
+12103557887,"Sep 15, 2014 11:15 PM",No,"Oh, and if you want to take a photo, then take a photo. I don't mind. "
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:19 PM",No,￼You're never too old to play with huge amounts of pillows!
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:19 PM",No,"Don't be nostalgic, just bring the fun back! "
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:26 PM",Yes,=)
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:26 PM",Yes,That looks like so much fun. I've got like 4 pillows that's it haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:27 PM",Yes,Maybe I can get some cushions from a couch off craigslist.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:26 PM",No,That wall didn't even contain all of my pillows Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:27 PM",No,Ooooorrr you could get a new couch off of craigslist and then just buy some pillows haha
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:28 PM",Yes,Hahaha. I'm so used to sitting on the floor now.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:28 PM",No,I can understand why lol
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:29 PM",Yes,Have you ever crashed into a wall of cushions though? not pillows. It's quite satisfying.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:30 PM",No,Yeah I have. The pillows are quite similar. Just fluffier. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:30 PM",No,I'm about to invest in a sleeping bags to slide down the stairs in. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:30 PM",No,I've got good sleeping bag-sliding stairs. 
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM",Yes,Sleeping bags?? Alright I'm listening.
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM",Yes,We always did laundry baskets
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM",No,Have you never done that?
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:31 PM",Yes,It usually ended in bruises.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:32 PM",No,You get the sleeping bags that are slippery on the outside and sit in it. It's glorious!
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:33 PM",No,There's very little room for injury too. Just as long as you keep your head from whacking against anything. 
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,Well the first time we had stairs they were made of marble shards so... I wouldn't have tried anything that didn't have some sort of shield for my bum.
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,Or head
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:33 PM",No,I wouldn't have even messed with marble stairs!
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:34 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:33 PM",No,That's pretty hardcore. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:34 PM",No,Did it have a suitable banister to slide down? 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:35 PM",No,I slid down a wooden banister once. Bad idea when wearing shorts...
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:37 PM",Yes,It was super splintery. This was when we lived in Italy. So everything was built like 20 millennia ago. With shorts?? Burn? Or splinters?
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:39 PM",No,Leg splinters and a bit of a burn. I have bad luck with doing things that end up injuring me while wearing shorts though. Maybe the injuries happen because I'm wearing the shorts in the first place...but I still get injured though...
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:41 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:41 PM",No,"Needless to say, I don't wear shorts incredibly often. "
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,The first time I ever slid down a railing was at this one museum. I saw a really long one. In a hall way and I just jumped onto it. I straddled it like a horse and started sliding. When I got close to the end I noticed it was one that leveled out.
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,Very painful. I'm a side saddler now.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:44 PM",No,Bwahahahahahahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,"I usually don't get hurt very often. However I do get my hands cut on things at work all the time. Ad signs, underside of shelves, packaging on merch. Sigh"
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:49 PM",Yes,How did you get all the splinters out? How old were you?
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:48 PM",No,My mom grew up in Hong Kong and her best friend was the Governors' daughter. They lived in the Governors mansion. Which was basically a palace. One time when she was visiting her friend she decided to be adventurous and slide down the enormous marble banister which led to the formal entryway. She talked her friend into it. They were greeted at the bottom of the stairs by the head housekeeper and the butler. My mom very quickly earned the reputation of trouble-maker in that house. Which I think is pretty hilarious. She's got some funny stories about staying with her friend Kate in that mansion. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:48 PM",No,"I think I was 12 or so. And I learned how to use tweezers at a very young age. So I got to pluck the wood out myself. Thanks, mom..."
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 10:51 PM",No,And I'm clumsy. So I get hurt alllll the time. But still not as much as my youngest sister. She always has something fractured or broken. My hurts are typically small ones. Or ankle related. My feet have been through a lot haha
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 10:59 PM",Yes,"Haha your mom sounds awesome lol. It's funny. I was probably the worst out of my sibling in terms of doing dangerous and stupid things. But I everyone thought I was an angel because I never got caught. Though when I would do something really bad I would typically walk up to my parents and just straight confess to them. Which a lot of times would get me spared from consequences. Haha. \LF\LFThe first time I ever had splinters my grandfather, uncle, and father all took me into the bathroom. And they didn't have tweezers. They had a pocket knife. That was the last day I ever let anyone try to help me with a wound."
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:00 PM",Yes,I wish I had tweezers back then.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:03 PM",No,"A pocket knife?!?! Yikes!! That's not cool at all! I'm pretty good at helping with wounds. But my kids don't like it when I take their band aids off. I'm a member of the ""ripping it off is better"" tribe. "
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:03 PM",No,And my mom is pretty crazy. She had a very different childhood and therefore has some cool stories. She still drives me pretty crazy sometimes though. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:05 PM",No,"I was, and probably still am, the least likely to do something dangerous out of my siblings. Unless you count climbing trees as dangerous. Okay... maybe I'm now the most dangerous... but 15 years ago it wasn't me even by a long shot! "
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:10 PM",Yes,"Ew bandaids. I've told you about my policy on sticky things right? No tape or stickers or bandaids for me. *shudder* I can manage wrapping gifts. But oh gosh. I can't even hardly zone bandaids in A-Block.\LF\LFI used to climb trees a lot. I would build stuff up in the trees. Walls, chairs, slingshots."
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:18 PM",No,"Yeah I have trouble with stuff sticking to me as well. But sometimes a bandaid is necessary. I really have trouble with foam egg crates. For whatever reason the feel of them literally makes me so nauseous I almost pass out. Can't touch them with bare hands. \LF\LFI used to live in the cherry trees in my backyard. And they weren't small trees either. We didn't have a treehouse, but I made my own house up in the limbs anyway. I'd spend hours up there reading books. Feeling the wind play with my hair. Picking fresh cherries off of the branches and eating them. Taking handfuls of honeysuckle flowers off of the honeysuckle bush next to the tree and eating the flowers. Sigh. The pillows didn't make me nostalgic, but now I'm totally there..."
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,"Foam egg cartons... Ok noted lol. \LF\LFI love that feeling. Makes my heart ache just a bit, but not in a bad way. There are songs and phrases that will do it to me."
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,Oh gosh especial when my brother is around. He quotes so many things we used to watch when I was little. Then when I was 9 we moved and he stayed in Florida. When he moved back in with use a couple years ago he used to spout out little inside jokes we used to have. I wouldn't understand the reference or remember the context. But my feels would start going.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:30 PM",No,"I have a couple songs. But not many. Even though my family is very musical, music wasn't a huge part of my upbringing. Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"", Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite"", any James Taylor, and a few old church songs will get my heart-strings going. But that's about it from my childhood. The rest is all music I discovered as an adult. "
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,There's a lot of old church songs that get me.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:36 PM",No,I bet there are! 
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:37 PM",Yes,Haha I'm not quite sure I understand the reasoning behind the exclamatory.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:43 PM",No,"Well, because of your Dad's job you probably spent a lot of time in church listening to old songs. Therefore old church songs were most likely monumentally important during your formative childhood years. Thus, I can only imagine that there would be a fair amount of old church songs which would lead you to reminisce about your childhood. "
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:43 PM",No,So...I bet there are!
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Perhaps it was the enthusiasm that threw you off haha
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:45 PM",Yes,It was!
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:45 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:45 PM",No,Hahaha sorry
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:46 PM",Yes,I enjoy your enthusiasms though. Haha I just thought maybe you had some weird reason behind it.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:45 PM",No,I was afraid that not including the exclamation point would make the comment seem sarcastic. So I made a risky move on  the outcome of the phrase and ended up losing anyway. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:45 PM",No,Texting always seems to give me problems. 
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:48 PM",Yes,Not necessarily losing. If there was no exclamation I might have taken it the wrong way. But I wouldn't have asked you to clarify. The exclamation made me want to ask you.
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:48 PM",No,In both receiving and sending. Oh well...such is the means of communication in this modern day and age. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:48 PM",No,Gotcha. Maybe I should've just gone with another phrase altogether haha
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:48 PM",No,"How about ""I can understand how there would be a lot of church songs that make you feel nostalgic""? "
+17069923021,"Sep 16, 2014 11:52 PM",Yes,"I like the way it came out originally. I like texting because it's easier to share my thoughts. It's like the other person is in my brain. But the downside is you lose so much of the communication through tones, guestures, and expressions. Also shouldn't you be asleep? Am I keeping you up?"
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:53 PM",No,"I should be asleep, yes. But I had a really big day and I'm still kind of processing everything. "
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:54 PM",No,I think I just prefer hearing someone's voice. I'm all about language and sound though. 
+12103557887,"Sep 16, 2014 11:55 PM",No,But texting can be somewhat more convenient at times. I suppose. 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,Speaking is so challenging sometimes lol. I'm so easily disrupted when I'm speaking verbally. If only we could communicate telepathically.
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,That would be amazing. But also dangerous.
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,Cause random thoughts could pop in at anytime.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:01 AM",No,"Hahaha I was just typing ""how would you filter your thoughts though?"""
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,Haha yeah
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:02 AM",No,"See, the telepathic thing is already working. To some extent..."
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:02 AM",Yes,That would turn out badly. Unless you were talking with someone that you were just 100% comfortable with lol. And they're used to all the weird stuff that pops into your brain.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:02 AM",No,Even being comfortable with someone I think there would still be things you'd want to keep to yourself. 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,But it's not really honed for direct communication with words and stuff. At least not in my experience.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:05 AM",No,"I was just referencing how we were coming to the same conclusion at the same time. Which is of course not really telepathic thinking at all, but more the ability to analyze the direction in which a thought or theory will take a conversation. "
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:08 AM",Yes,Maybe I was guiding the conversation by influencing your thoughts... Hmmmm?\LF\LFI have one friend of mine that I think I would feel comfortable being in a telepathic conversation with. Haha. I don't think I would have any issue with him.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:09 AM",No,"Guiding the conversation seems like the right answer, yes"
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:09 AM",No,I suppose I'd be okay with my best friend Isel knowing 100% of my thoughts. If I had to choose someone...
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:09 AM",No,I don't filter anything with her anyway. 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:12 AM",Yes,Would you be comfortable with what might pop into her mind as well?
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:13 AM",No,Yeah. She doesn't filter either Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:15 AM",Yes,I got a new puzzle today. I've been working on it for the past 3 hours.
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,Just trying to take it apart.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:17 AM",No,Haha good grief. I don't have that kind of patience at all! 
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 12:20 AM",No,"And on a different note, I'm going to lay down now. Try to get a few hours of rest for tomorrow. Goodnight Andrew! "
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,"Maybe it's not that you lack the patience. But for you, the reward of finding it's solution isn't worth the patience required to reach it. ;D Goodnight Jessie. Have a restful night."
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 10:25 AM",No,"That's most likely true. Not that I don't like games which test my logic and reasoning skills, but I probably don't find much of a reward in solving these types of puzzles. I enjoy fast thinking much more than planned strategic thought. How well do I think on my toes, instead of how one choice influences 50 other choices. Not that I can't see the forest, but I do like individual trees hahaha"
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,So maybe a puzzle that has several rewarding stages. Do you like jigsaw puzzles? Of course those aren't really too logic based. The thing I like about tangible puzzles like these is the eventual understanding of the system. I want to know every possible thing I can do to it and every possible outcome resulting from my actions. Also I did finish taking apart the puzzle last night. Roughly 4 hours. I haven't gotten it back together again lol... Yet.\LF\LFIs there an activity that you like to do a lot that utilizes your excellent reasoning skills? 
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:08 AM",No,I don't know that I have excellent reasoning skills Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:10 AM",Yes,You're observant. How about that? lol
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:10 AM",No,I play Sudoku sometimes. Or other fast paced card games like Solitaire and Freecell. 
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:10 AM",No,"Yes, I am observant. "
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:10 AM",No,I've never really thought about what I do to sharpen these skills. I think I just read a lot and have as many intellectual conversations as possible. 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:13 AM",Yes,Hmm so challenging you to a game of memory might not be wise if it's my intent to win lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:16 AM",Yes,"I care too much for sudoku or solitaire. However, minesweeper is one I can play an occasional game of."
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:34 AM",No,"No, I'm good at memory games!"
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:40 AM",No,There's a card game I'm going to have to find and teach you how to play. It's called Set. I think you'd like it. 
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:40 AM",No,It's in one of my unpacked boxes somewhere...
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:43 AM",Yes,Ooh what's it involve?
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:44 AM",No,"Matching up cards to clear the deck as quickly as possible. But it's not memory, it's logic which is involved because the cards have different qualities which you can use to make a group, so the groups can be different every time you use the cards. It's very fast and fun. Have you played Blink before? That one is fun too. And also in a box somewhere. Man, I need to finish unpacking!"
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,I haven't heard kf that one either lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 11:44 AM",No,Then I've got two games to teach you!
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 9:03 PM",Yes,I very much look forward to that. =D
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,Are you and the kids going trick or treating?
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 9:14 PM",Yes,"I think we're going to have a Halloween thingy at either mine or matts place. Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever dressed up for Halloween. Haha I think because I never really had friends to do it with. I really want to do it this year though. Wear some sort of ridiculous costume."
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 9:16 PM",No,"The kids will be with their Dad for Halloween. So I don't know, but he'll probably take them out that night. I haven't dressed up since I was 14 hahaha"
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,Haha want to dress up and hang out with us? 
+17069923021,"Sep 17, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,I'm assuming we'll play games and maybe hand out candy. You know we're kind of a mellow group lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 17, 2014 9:20 PM",No,Haha yeah I can try to come up with some sort of costume. If it wouldn't be weird for me to be there...
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:01 AM",Yes,Why would it be weird? Don't we all get along fairly well?
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:01 AM",Yes,And there's a game Matt and I just acquired that works kinda like balderdash. And you have to play it.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:02 AM",No,We do. I just don't want people to feel strange since I used to be the boss. I think I've always been careful about that. So maybe I'm just over-analyzing. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:02 AM",No,What's it called? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,"I don't think anyone feels that way. Reggie thought it was odd the very first time I asked you to come to the movies with us when we first started hanging out, but it don't think he thinks that anymore. But that was still shortly after you left anyway. I know Kris, Matt, and Jerry like having you around. And we definitely wouldn't have had as much fun if you hadn't come to game night and brought Heads Up lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:08 AM",Yes,And it's called Fibbage.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:11 AM",No,"I think it started before Reggie though. I remember getting a weird vibe when I met up with you guys at Monster Golf, but I was only there for a second so that could have been part of it. And I definitely felt like Reggie and Kelli were uncomfortable at the movies. I don't know, I just don't want people to feel weird around me. But if I'm worrying about it too much then I can stop. \LF\LFAnd I've never heard of Fibbage before. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:28 AM",Yes,Oh yeah that was weird. Haha. But it was because we weren't doing anything. We didn't want to just leave because we knew you had dropped by to see us and had just got there as we were getting ready to leave. And you had prior plans so you weren't coming with us. It was just an awkward moment because no one wanted to be rude by just leaving immediately after you showed up.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:29 AM",No,Well it was my fault that I was running so late. I guess I shouldn't count that time then haha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:33 AM",Yes,"Yeah that totally doesn't count. Cause even I felt a little weird about it haha. \LF\LFIn Fibbage you take turns choosing a category from a few that are offered to you. Weird category's like Red, Geoffrey, flooring, fear. Then they ask a question and you have to have to come up with an answer that sounds legit. Pretty much exactly like Balderdash. Then people vote and so on and so forth. The category and questions are just a bit weird sometimes."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:34 AM",No,Well sorry I made you feel weird then haha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:34 AM",No,And yeah that sounds like Balderdash
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:37 AM",Yes,It wasn't your fault. It was just the situation.\LFAnd this is played with the PS4 and your phones/tablets. So you don't have to worry about handwriting or wasting paper.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:38 AM",No,So it's an app? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:40 AM",Yes,"no, you actually just go to the Fibbage website on your phone, then you give it the four character ""room code"". Then it starts running in your web browser. I suppose you could even use a computer. Hmm now I want to try that."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:42 AM",No,So everyone links in to it from a smart device at the same time?
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:42 AM",Yes,Yup
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:43 AM",Yes,It's pretty sweet
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:42 AM",No,Oh technology hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:43 AM",Yes,It gets my techno feathers hot and bothered... So to speak lol. Ok that was a bit weird.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:44 AM",No,Hahahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:44 AM",No,Your feathers are being tickled? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:45 AM",Yes,Uhhh. Sure lol
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:45 AM",Yes,Feathers don't have nerves though!
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:45 AM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:45 AM",No,I was trying to make it a little less risqué haha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,Haha that works then
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,Oh boy. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,Excited.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",Yes,There we go.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",No,"And while a feather doesn't have a nerve, the movement of the feather stimulates nerves... So it kind of produces a similar reaction to what I was hoping you'd describe. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:46 AM",No,*you were describing
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:47 AM",No,That didn't make much sense haha 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:48 AM",Yes,I understood you perfectly haha.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:48 AM",No,Did you? That's good. I get worried that my thought process can be confusing. As I know it often is. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:51 AM",Yes,"I'll typically ask you to clarify. Haha. Which I'm pretty sure has happened a few times lol. ""Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it."""
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:51 AM",No,Hahahaha too true too true
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:52 AM",No,That was a seriously awesome movie. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:52 AM",No,Did you ever figure out the other movie the song reminded you of? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:54 AM",Yes,"So I was thinking the other day, after you told me about how you liked raccoons. I'm gonna venture off onto a ledge and guess that Rocket was your favourite character?"
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:54 AM",Yes,No I didn't haha. I meant to look up the soundtrack. I'm going to do it right now.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:55 AM",No,No it was Drax actually. Or Star Lord. They've kind of tied. But for different reasons. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:56 AM",Yes,My second guess would have been addax lol
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:56 AM",Yes,*Drax
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 11:57 AM",Yes,What's your reasoning behind it. That's the best part.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 11:59 AM",No,"I think I liked him best because I could identify with his very matter-of-fact, I don't get the metaphors, way of thinking. Plus I know that I'm very dry in my delivery of pretty much everything, so seeing a theatrical overly dramatized version of myself (or a sense of myself at the very least) was pretty funny. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:41 PM",Yes,Haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:43 PM",Yes,And Starlord because... He's a goof and is passionate about doing what's right even though it's certain suicide?
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:45 PM",Yes,And it was a seriously awesome movie. I'm really tempted to go back and see it again this weekend.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:46 PM",No,Just cause that's the type of humor I would WANT to have. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:46 PM",No,Or be comfortable with showing. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:46 PM",No,I want to see it again too! Haha I was contemplating turning right back around to the box office and buying another ticket when we were there 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:48 PM",Yes,I totally asked you if you wanted to do that! Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:49 PM",Yes,And I think the song was the Jackson 5 song now that I think about it. I'm not sure why now though. It just felt out of place for some reason. I need to go see it again to see if I still feel the same way about it.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:50 PM",No,I thought you were joking though! 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:50 PM",No,Hahaha fail
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:53 PM",Yes,I totally would have if you were actually serious about it lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:55 PM",Yes,But I was the driver and I don't think anyone else would have wanted to stay. I guess Jerry could have driven them though lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:56 PM",Yes,"Have you heard the Hasselhof version of ""Hooked on a Feeling""? I was slightly hoping that was the one they were going to use."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:57 PM",No,Well I guess next time I'll just check to see if you're being serious or not. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:57 PM",No,"No, I've never heard it. But I'll google it right now. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:57 PM",No,I'm glad they went with the original. Such a good song. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:58 PM",Yes,Make sure you get the actual music video too. It's ridiculous.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 12:58 PM",Yes,weiner dogs and angels
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:59 PM",No,Oh good grief haha 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 12:59 PM",No,I'll see what I can find 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:00 PM",Yes,"Just type ""Hasselhoff hooked on a feeling"" into the YouTubez. And Godspeed."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:01 PM",No,"Okay so the first thing that came up was ""David Hasselhoff hooked on a feeling literal version"" I'm pretty sure it's not the same thing, but it's still hilarious hahaha"
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:02 PM",Yes,Nope nip
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:02 PM",Yes,That's a good one
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:02 PM",Yes,It's the same video.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:01 PM",No,You've seen it? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",Yes,Oh yeah. This video is one of my life anthems hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",No,"The ""literal"" version?"
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",Yes,Yes lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:04 PM",Yes,"""Director smoked skmethiiiiiiiing!"""
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",No,And life anthems? Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",No,You've got life anthems?
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:04 PM",Yes,I have a few. I guess they're more like theme songs.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:04 PM",Yes,I like to imagine if credits were to roll at the end of my life. These are the songs that would play.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",No,Like your funeral songs? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:05 PM",Yes,Oh gosh. I don't know if I would want to torture my friends and family like that.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:03 PM",No,And I now understand why David Hasselhoff is so big in Germany Bwahahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:05 PM",No,Would it be torture though? I think they'd appreciate you having your last word and being true to yourself through to the end. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:05 PM",No,"Like how Joan Rivers did her funeral. No one saw it as a bad thing at all. In fact, the silliness seemed to help many of the people who were there to celebrate her life. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:12 PM",Yes,"This might seem weird. But there's something I've wanted to do for years but just never really got enough motivation to do it. I want to write a long speech to have read at my funeral. And keep it updated monthly so that it was relevant as to make it seem I was still a living thinking entity. Then since I would update it monthly, the off chance I were to have an unfortunate departure the most recent version would be the one to be read."
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:13 PM",Yes,And I didn't really hear much of what went on at Joan Rivers funeral.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:20 PM",No,That sounds like an incredibly complicated way to day goodbye Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:20 PM",No,*say
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:20 PM",No,I need to make my will. Especially now that my life situation has changed. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:21 PM",Yes,I'm all about showmanship though lol. I want to leave with bang.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:22 PM",No,Like Hunter S. Thompson? He asked to be shot into space from a ten-foot cannon. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,What?
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:22 PM",No,The writer. Hunter S. Thompson wanted to leave with a bang. So when he died they cremated him and shot his ashes into the atmosphere through a ten-foot cannon. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:22 PM",No,"That's what you were wanting clarification on, right? "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:23 PM",Yes,I... Don't even know how to respond.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:23 PM",Yes,Yes
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:24 PM",No,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:24 PM",Yes,Haha that made me think of something terrible.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:24 PM",No,Yeah pretty epic
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:24 PM",No,Of what? 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:26 PM",Yes,"As a closing in my speech, ""And just so everyone knows... I requested that my body be cremated and distributed amongst the snacks and refreshments. Haha Suckers! (long pause) Just kidding. That's kinda gross. Sorry mom."""
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:27 PM",Yes,Would you have any odd final requests?
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:28 PM",No,Oh Lordy. You're gonna have to write the letter now. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:29 PM",No,"I don't know about ""odd requests"". I haven't really thought about it. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:31 PM",No,"I do know of one song I want played though. ""Sweet Disposition"" by the Temper Trap. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:31 PM",No,I'd probably come up with a playlist. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:33 PM",No,"And I wouldn't want a normal funeral. Probably make everyone go out in the middle of nowhere in the forest, start a campfire, and add my ashes to the fire. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:33 PM",No,"I don't expect that many people would be wanting to go to my funeral. And those who do go, I wouldn't want for them to sit in a stuffy church and cry. And I certainly wouldn't want to be embalmed and put in a coffin in the ground. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:38 PM",Yes,"That's quite creative. I would go, though I hope I wouldn't have to."
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:39 PM",Yes,Anna's was in a church. It was definitely unlike anything I would have imagined. There were a lot of jokes and songs.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:40 PM",No,That's good. A true celebration. That's what I think a funeral should be like. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:48 PM",Yes,"Sweet Disposition, I am familiar with that song. Sounds suiting."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:49 PM",No,The title? Or the song itself is suiting?
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:51 PM",Yes,"The sound of the song. It sounds like a song that should be played after an extensive battle with a great evil. One that was victorious, but held many casualties."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:52 PM",No,Hahahaha and that's the only way I'd be dying anyway...
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 1:58 PM",Yes,"This the the image I get when I hear it. Ignoring the lyrics and just listening to the sound. I picture a woman, a warrior, with dirt on her face and blood on her clothes. Kneeled in a field of destruction. Fires burning what's left of the sun scorched grass. Lifeless armor lying around her. She holds in her lap the helmet of someone she cared for."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:59 PM",No,That's a pretty epic image
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:00 PM",Yes,"On a side note, I'm so close to finishing Princess Bride, I've been trying to read it for the last hour."
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:00 PM",Yes,Very epic. I wish I could describe is better. Better yet I wish I could draw.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 1:59 PM",No,"And I'm the same way when it comes to listening to music. Sometimes the lyrics will not speak to me at all, it's all about the feel of the song. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:01 PM",No,No wonder you've got epic melodrama on your mind! 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:01 PM",No,And I can't draw either. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:01 PM",Yes,=( we're doomed.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:01 PM",No,But I could dress the scene and take a good photograph!
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:01 PM",No,Which would almost be better anyway. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:03 PM",Yes,"It would, if you could stage everything perfectly. I bet it would be fun to be a location scout for fantasy films."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:05 PM",No,That would be pretty awesome! 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:05 PM",No,I want to travel sooooo badly. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:08 PM",Yes,I sadly took it for granted quite a bit growing up. Most often because I was stuck with my parents. And although I absolutely adore my parents. It's not quite the same as exploring a country with your friends.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",Yes,So the times I did get to go off on my own with my friends. Those are the times I really treasure.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:07 PM",No,I can imagine so. The only foreign country I've ever been to is Canada. And I'm not sure that counts. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",Yes,We would sometimes go to Venice after school to hang out and buy chocolate.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:10 PM",Yes,Canada counts!
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",No,"I'd love to visit New Zealand, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, China, and Switzerland. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:10 PM",Yes,Well I would buy chocolate.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",No,Chocolate is a good thing!
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:11 PM",Yes,I just want to go to New Zealand to listen to them. Omg. I can't even. They're accent.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:11 PM",Yes,I just melt when I hear it.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",No,The Kiwis? 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:09 PM",No,I used to be able to do a Kiwi accent. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:18 PM",Yes,"Yeah if you ever want to turn me into soggy butter, just throw a kiwi at me. And I'm not talking about the fruit. At my second college, I had this required freshmen prep class(super waste of time). And there was this girl in my class named Lucy Bird. She had moved from New Zealand to go to school in Columbus, GA. I have no idea why. But I would just sit and wait for her to open her mouth. Now that I think about it, that sounds kinda creepy. Don't judge me lol."
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:20 PM",No,I can't imagine throwing fruit at you hahaha especially with your objections to that food group in general
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:20 PM",No,I don't judge. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:24 PM",Yes,"+1 for considering my ""objections to that food group"""
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:24 PM",Yes,I've mentioned to you my minor obsession with visiting North Korea right?
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:29 PM",No,"Yes I've been made aware of that obsession before haha and I think my response was ""why in the world would you ever want to go there?!?!?!!!"""
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:30 PM",Yes,Haha that sounds about right.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:31 PM",No,Yeah I'm pretty predictable I guess haha
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:38 PM",Yes,"It's not that you're predictable. Quite often your responses to things are not what I would expect. Also I'm more interested in your reasoning behind responses. It's just that the ""what ?!?"" is typically what I hear when I bring North Korea up. I would so very much like to go to the other Korea and developed places in China"
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:39 PM",Yes,"And maybe you are predictable, but I'm still learning how you think."
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 2:40 PM",Yes,People can be quite complex. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:44 PM",No,Sometimes I'm not even sure how I think myself haha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 2:48 PM",No,I suppose it's a good thing that I can still be surprising though. That I still have some quirks left to be discovered. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 4:19 PM",Yes,And then of course Japan is my number one. So do you have particular reasons you want to visit those places in particular? Such as specific things you want to see?
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:20 PM",No,Oh! I forgot Japan! And Greece! 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 4:20 PM",Yes,I've been to Greece!
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:20 PM",No,I would like to see the landscape. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:20 PM",No,I'm sure you have haha
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:21 PM",No,"One of my friends lives in Spain. He invited the kids and I to go stay with him for a bit for a vacation, but I don't know if I'd be able to make that happen anytime soon. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:21 PM",No,"I'd love to go to Europe to see the old architecture. Cathedrals, stone work, etc. "
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:22 PM",No,But everywhere else would mostly be for the outdoor beauty. 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 4:24 PM",No,I really like to explore. That's just hard to do here in Texas. It's too hot most of the time. 
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 6:12 PM",Yes,Definitely. Though I had some fun exploring that quarry. I just want to hear people talk and read signs.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 6:13 PM",Yes,I think translating my way around Japan would be awesome.
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 6:13 PM",Yes,You should go!! It's so nice to have someone to use as a base camp lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 6:15 PM",No,"Go to Spain? I'd love to, but I'm sure it would be an expense I couldn't afford for a bit. In the meantime I'm just making goals about where I'd like to travel and dreaming about the adventures I'll have. "
+17069923021,"Sep 18, 2014 6:22 PM",Yes,Yeah... tickets can be expensive. =/ 
+12103557887,"Sep 18, 2014 6:24 PM",No,Well hopefully I'll be a grown up who can afford to travel sooner rather than later. 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:37 PM",Yes,Have you played Khet before? ￼
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:40 PM",No,I have not. It looks complex haha
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:42 PM",Yes,I've been wanting to buy it since I was in highschool but I've never had anyone interested in trying it with me lol. 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:42 PM",Yes,It's just like a chess game.. With mirrors... And lasers!
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:43 PM",No,Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:43 PM",No,You're excited!
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:45 PM",Yes,It's hard not to be when it comes to lasers!
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:48 PM",No,Haha true true 
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:48 PM",No,I'm not even all that good at chess though 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:52 PM",Yes,Neither am I lol. Would you play with me? I could make it even cooler with dry ice.
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:53 PM",Yes,And that was punintentional.
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 3:54 PM",Yes,Oh I'm on a roll today.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:54 PM",No,Hahaha oh Lord 
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 3:54 PM",No,Yeah I'd play it
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 5:19 PM",No,Plans for Sunday yet? I hope to be fully unpacked and ready for guests tomorrow so I was thinking if people were willing to drive over here on Sunday we could do dinner and a game night. Let me know what you think. 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 6:38 PM",Yes,That sounds awesome. Who should I ask?
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 6:39 PM",No,It's up to you. Whoever you think would want to come I guess. And it doesn't have to be exactly at dinner time. The afternoon is fine. 
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 6:40 PM",No,"Or if no one wants to come, then you're free to come on your own. "
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 6:41 PM",No,I guess I'm just putting it out there to do something on Sunday haha
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 8:06 PM",Yes,"Ok, yeah I'm super down. I can bring some games too. What would be the earliest? And you can teach us set!"
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 8:10 PM",No,Hmmmm the earliest would maybe be 1. I'm going to try out the church my Mom wanted me to try. 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,=)
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,I hope you like it.
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 8:11 PM",Yes,Did she bug you about it again? Or is this of your own volition.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 8:10 PM",No,A little of both haha
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 8:13 PM",No,Just let me know how many people I should be expecting so that I can make sure I've got the right amount of food haha
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,What? You don't have to feed us lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 8:21 PM",No,I said DINNER and a game night lol
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"My mom texted me earlier that today was ""National Talk Like a Pirate Day"". We proceeded to have a conversation in pirate speech for 30 minutes. I guess sometimes she's cool. Haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,Arrh! Yer right! Me mind is all washed up. 
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:51 PM",No,Ye happened to google it eh?
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,We were supposed to be able to get free donuts from KK for talking like a pirate today.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:51 PM",No,Oh. Nevermind. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,I knew it was coming lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:52 PM",No,The google? Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:52 PM",No,The immediate response makes sense then 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:52 PM",Yes,Wait huh?
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,Hah I'm so lost. What about google?
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:53 PM",No,Hahahahaha I thought you meant that you knew I was going to ask if you googled it
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,Oh haha.
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",No,We were at different places in that conversation 
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",Yes,No I didn't google it lol. I follow Krispy Kreme on Facebook lol. So each year they remind me like a week or two beforehand lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",Yes,Our timing is off haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",Yes,Resync
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",No,Do they only do that for pirate talk days?
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:54 PM",No,"Give away the freebies, I mean "
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:56 PM",Yes,They do stuff a few times a year. They did something for 12/12/12
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:56 PM",No,"And how would you order a doughnut in pirate speech anyway? \LF\LF""Arrrr, aye'll be havin' one of them there jelly-filled confections, arrrrn the double!"""
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:56 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:56 PM",No,Gotcha
+12103557887,"Sep 19, 2014 11:57 PM",No,Too bad there isn't one close to me anymore. Sigh
+17069923021,"Sep 19, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,You poor soul. There's one kinda close to me. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,There were several around where we lived in Georgia.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:00 AM",No,I had never even heard of them till they came to San Antonio ten years ago. And I've probably only had their doughnuts a handful of times. They're all right.  
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:01 AM",No,I feel like they're almost TOO sweet. You know? 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,I like really sweet donuts. I think KK are prolly my favourite out of the ones I've had.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:04 AM",No,Did you go to any of the famous Seattle doughnut shops? 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,"I didn't. The only donuts if had on the trip were the ones at Voodoo. If I recall correctly, I really only had that one day in Seattle with my mom and sister. "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:06 AM",Yes,And we only went to the aquarium and out to eat. And we walked around the market.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:07 AM",No,"Gotcha. Well, next time..."
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:07 AM",Yes,Are there a lot? I wasn't aware that was a Seattle thing.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:08 AM",No,It's mostly a Portland thing. But some of the shops have made it up to Seattle too. 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:09 AM",No,Voodoo is one of the bigger ones
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:10 AM",Yes,Man... I sure miss that weather.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:11 AM",Yes,Though you probably miss it more than I.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:11 AM",No,Yes I do!!! Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:11 AM",No,I've never felt like a Texan. And I've now lived here more than half of my life. Unfortunately. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,I don't feel like an anything.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:13 AM",No,You feel like an Andrew. And that's enough. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:13 AM",Yes,That is... yes... I'll take that.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:13 AM",No,"Should I have said ""more than enough""? Haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:14 AM",Yes,Haha I don't know. Am I? I can't really speak for myself on this one haha. I'm biased.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:13 AM",No,I meant that you don't need to be anything more than who you are. And you're Andrew. So that's enough for me. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,Well thank you. That makes me feel quite adequate. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,=P
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:15 AM",No,I feel like I'm still missing the mark haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:16 AM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:15 AM",No,Adequate isn't the right word at all
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:15 AM",No,"And I suppose ""enough"" isn't right either "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:17 AM",Yes,I understand the idea you are conveying to me.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:17 AM",No,Good. Cause I keep trying to expand on it and nothing comes out the way I want it to. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,I think the following:
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:20 AM",No,"You are the sum of your experiences, and since you are unique in what you have lived and thought throughout your life, the only thing you could possibly be is who you are. And you are Andrew. "
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:20 AM",No,So you don't need to feel like an anything. Because you are more than just a SOMEthing. You are you. And that's all you need to be. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:22 AM",Yes,Thank you Jessie.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:23 AM",No,For what? 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:23 AM",No,And I just realized I cut you off! I'm sorry! 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:23 AM",Yes,You give off this encouraging vibe.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:24 AM",No,"Oh haha well, it's not an extra effort. That's just me. "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,no that's ok. I started to lose where I was going so I stopped. And then hoped you forgot I was saying something lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:25 AM",No,Haha I'm an elephant. I don't forget. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,Where's your trunk??
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,You have no trunk!!
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:26 AM",No,Technically........if you go with the slang term....
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:26 AM",Yes,Oh goodness. lol
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:27 AM",No,Hahahahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:27 AM",No,"Hey, you asked about the trunk"
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:28 AM",Yes,"Hey, you knew what I was refering to haha."
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:28 AM",No,"Well, but then you said I didn't have one. Haha so I just tried to think of a witty response "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:29 AM",Yes,Not naughty no-no nonsense.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:29 AM",Yes,Oh that alliteration.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:29 AM",No,Was that naughty? 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:29 AM",No,Sorry 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:30 AM",Yes,I was over exaggerating. Plus I needed a nice string of n-words.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:30 AM",Yes,And naughty fit nicely.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:30 AM",No,I suppose it did 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:31 AM",Yes,But no I was joking. You are quite clever.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:32 AM",No,Don't want to make anyone uncomfortable though...
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:32 AM",Yes,I think I still have the crown for the most inappropriate actions/words. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:32 AM",Yes,You were not making me uncomfortable.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:32 AM",No,You did one thing! Just one! And it was funny! 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:34 AM",Yes,Still can't believe that actually happened.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:34 AM",No,And good. I'm glad you weren't uncomfortable. 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:34 AM",No,I was about to do the same thing before I stopped myself. So I totally believe it!
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:35 AM",Yes,Oh my gosh. If we had both done that at the same time... I would have run outside and cried on the sidewalk.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:36 AM",No,I was crying anyway hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:36 AM",No,I really did stop myself though haha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:37 AM",No,"I was thinking ""how could that action be done in a way that isn't overly suggestive?"" And I couldn't think of anything else to do, but you went ahead and took over, so I didn't even have to worry about it at that point"
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:37 AM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:37 AM",No,Best mime ever. Hands down. 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:38 AM",No,And not anything to be ashamed of at all. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:38 AM",Yes,I'm quite skilled in the art of pantomime. I trained in highschool lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:38 AM",No,Really? Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:39 AM",Yes,I'm quite proud actually. Well just as long as my mother doesn't see the video haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:40 AM",Yes,"Regarding the miming, not really. I majored in drama in highschool for a semester. We had a few weeks where we studied it. We had to do a few as projects."
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:40 AM",No,I did Commedia del'Arté masks in middle school. I still have a VHS of some of the performances. That was really cool. And I also did a clown workshop for a few weeks in one of my theater classes. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",Yes,But I do feel like I'm fairly good at it. I'm not sure why though. That's right you told me! I want to see some!
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",No,The mask troupe was my favorite though. It was way fun!
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",No,I have the tape. Just need a VHS player haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",Yes,I'll steal Kris's haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",Yes,He loves VHS
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:42 AM",Yes,I've been meaning to get a VHS recorder for my computer. I still haven't gotten one.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:41 AM",No,Haha oh no
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:42 AM",No,I haven't watched that tape in years! 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",Yes,I'd back it up for you.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",Yes,The VHS...
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",Yes,It's late. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",No,Bwahahahahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",No,I knew you meant the VHS!
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",No,"I'm sorry, I'm keeping you up! "
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:43 AM",No,Go to bed and we can talk more later 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",Yes,Awww right haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",Yes,I actually do need sleep. I gotta go to work at 730.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",Yes,*aww alright
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",No,Then go to bed!
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",No,And sleep well
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:46 AM",Yes,This is just so much fun though! But ok.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 12:46 AM",Yes,Goodnight Jessie.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 12:45 AM",No,It is fun! But it won't stop tonight. Goodnight Andrew. 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:20 PM",Yes,"I think it's going to end up being Kris, Jerry, and I. Matt is being whiney saying he hasn't been able to play destiny enough. He even bailed on us last night to play, that booger."
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:20 PM",Yes,Would you like me to bring anything?
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:21 PM",No,Hahahaha that's funny 
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:24 PM",No,What time were you thinking of heading over? 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:30 PM",Yes,"4? I want to double check with Kris to see when he is free. Sometimes it is so hard get these people together. Kris is always over looking a prior engagement, Jerry only likes doing stuff when there are two people he knows really well, Reggie is always doing homework, Kelli is always driving to Austin, and Matt... Well Matt is just Matt haha."
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:31 PM",Yes,Oh I know. Matt is overly competitive in video games so he is always trying to get ahead. Right now he's trying to fetch up to Jerry in Destiny.
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:31 PM",Yes,*catch
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:32 PM",No,4 sounds good! Just keep me updated!
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:33 PM",Yes,"""Would you like me to bring anything?"", he inquired, ""Food, games, etc?"""
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:34 PM",No,Oh! I didn't get that text! I'll let you know tomorrow! 
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:34 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:36 PM",No,"Sorry, haha the last one was supposed to end with a question "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:37 PM",Yes,"You mean ""I'll let you know tomorrow?""? Is that what you mean?"
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:37 PM",No,Yes haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:40 PM",Yes,I shall inquire again tomorrow then.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:41 PM",No,I'll remember to tell you haha
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:43 PM",Yes,"Ok, here are some raccoons on the beach begging for barbecue Fritos.￼"
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:43 PM",No,That's kinda scary though. I wouldn't ever get close to one!
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 5:44 PM",Yes,Really? Not even people friendly ones?
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 5:47 PM",No,"Probably not. Raccoons are never actually friendly. They'll act nice to get food, but if you don't give them the food then they'll attack you. "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 8:47 PM",Yes,wow.. I totally passed out on my couch. Really? I wouldn't imagine a raccoon to be like that.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 9:33 PM",No,"Haha you were tired! Yeah, raccoons are not cute an cuddly at all. Their looks are deceiving. That's the true reason for the mask, I think. "
+17069923021,"Sep 20, 2014 9:37 PM",Yes,God being clever maybe? I really was. Today I fell asleep in the breakroom during a 15. I had a bit of a panic attack when I woke up cause I had no idea how long I had been asleep.
+12103557887,"Sep 20, 2014 10:14 PM",No,Yikes! Told you to go to be last night haha
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 12:55 PM",No,"Soooooo, I'm totally not going to be finished unpacking by 4. I discovered last night that one of my bookcases had broken and had to go searching for a new one this morning. Could we maybe hang out at your place today instead? And then mine in two weeks? I know you guys won't care, but I'd rather have everything completely done before I have people over. And right now my living room is a mess because I'm having to build two new bookcases to put stuff away. I feel bad..."
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 12:57 PM",No,I'll bring games though. And make dinner if you'd like.
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:13 PM",Yes,"Yeah that's ok. No, I understand you wanting things to be in order. On that note I do need to tidy my bathroom and pick everything up off the floor. Kris just texted me saying he won't be able to at 4 cause he's helping his mom move stuff in Poteet. But that he would come later. And I haven't heard from Jerry yet today. He hasn't answered me. So it might end up being just you and me for a while. Is that ok? I know I'm soo boring lol."
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:15 PM",No,Haha no no that's not even true at all! There's no way you're boring you silly goose. Did you still want me to come at 4? Or a different time? Thanks for being understanding. What did you want me to bring? 
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:16 PM",No,Games? Good? 
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:16 PM",No,Haha *food
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:17 PM",Yes,Haha yes games are good.
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:17 PM",Yes,Oh I thought you were trying for Tarzan.
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:17 PM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:17 PM",No,Haha yeah I went a little Paleolithic. 
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,"I think I can manage a quick apartment spruce by 4, maybe 430. Would you like to do something similar to the Spicy Mushroom Pasta night? We could find a recipe and split the cost for ingredients and then share cooking duties. Unless you already had some sort of food plan worked out."
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:25 PM",No,"I can do something similar to that, yeah. I have most of the ingredients at home already. I can just stop by HEB and get the last two things I'd need. Would you want anything with the pasta? Salad? Dessert? "
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:26 PM",No,"Unless you wanted to try a new recipe, otherwise I can just make what I've got on hand. "
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,"Oh yeah, I didn't mean specifically we had to have food similar to that night. I meant we could look for a recipe of any type of food. And then acquire what we needed for it."
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:29 PM",No,Ohhhhh gotcha
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:31 PM",Yes,What are your thought on that. Had you already got stuff for a specific type of meal?
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:31 PM",No,I have stuff for a pasta dish. But we don't have to do that. 
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:33 PM",No,Is there something you're in the mood for? 
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:52 PM",No,￼Told you. 
+17069923021,"Sep 21, 2014 1:58 PM",Yes,"Wow, you have a right to be embarrassed. Haha joking."
+12103557887,"Sep 21, 2014 1:59 PM",No,"Well, thanks haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 4:39 PM",Yes,"Agador was funnier, I agree."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 4:39 PM",Yes,"""They so stupid."""
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 4:39 PM",No,Hahahaha I'm glad you liked the movie!
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 4:40 PM",No,"""You CAN cook right?""\LF""Your father seems to think so..."""
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 4:41 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 4:41 PM",Yes,"""F#%£ the shrimp!"""
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 4:42 PM",No,"""I'm a combination of Lucy and Ricky. What do you think?""\LF""Horrifying."""
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 4:42 PM",No,Hahahahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 4:42 PM",No,Fun movie 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 5:01 PM",Yes,It was. I'm glad you brought it up. What's his name's yelps and screams had me dying.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 5:02 PM",Yes,"I love the way he delivers his lines, both in the birdcage and the producers."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 5:02 PM",Yes,Soooo dramatic!
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 5:58 PM",No,Yeah Nathan Lane is absolutely fantastic! 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:04 PM",No,We should watch The Producers next. It's been a while since I've seen it.  
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:06 PM",Yes,Yes yes yes.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:06 PM",Yes,I'm in pain! I'm in pain! I'm hysterical and I'm wet!
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:07 PM",No,Hahahahahaha 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:07 PM",Yes,Some really fun songs too.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:07 PM",No,And Will Ferrell as a Nazi sympathy at. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:07 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:07 PM",No,*sympathist
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:08 PM",Yes,"Adolf Elizabeth Hitler,"
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:08 PM",Yes,Elizabeth?
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:10 PM",Yes,Yes please haha. I'll be moving this coming weekend but maybe sometime after that I would love too.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:10 PM",Yes,*to
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:10 PM",Yes,I watched Hear No Evil See No Evil today.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:11 PM",Yes,"I keep forgetting how vulgar it is, but Richard and Gene to so well together."
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:12 PM",No,I haven't seen that one
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:14 PM",Yes,"What?? Richard Prior plays a blind guy, and Gene Wilder is deaf. And they... end up in the wrong place at the wrong time."
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:15 PM",No,Ohhhhh hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:15 PM",No,Thaaaat one
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:16 PM",No,"I've seen parts of it. Not all of it. But I read ""Richard Gere"" and the movie title with that actor didn't make sense.  "
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:16 PM",Yes,Oh haha my baaaad.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:17 PM",No,No no you wrote it correctly. It was entirely my  mistake haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:18 PM",Yes,"Well ok, I'll take a point for that then lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:18 PM",Yes,I'm trying to choose a board game at Target.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:21 PM",Yes,"I'm considering the following: Scrabble, LOGO Party, and Cranium."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:21 PM",Yes,Comments or suggestions?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:21 PM",No,Cranium's pretty cool. I own it. And Scrabble. But I've never heard of the other one. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:23 PM",Yes,"You get cards with brands on them. And you have to draw, describe, or act it out to guess the company."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:23 PM",Yes,Perfect for those who've dabbled in retail lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:44 PM",No,"And that makes sense considering the name is ""Logo"" hahaha"
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:45 PM",No,I feel like there's not that many good board games out there anymore. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:54 PM",Yes,no?
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:56 PM",Yes,Hmm I guess I can't really say. My thought would be that less interesting games have always outnumbered good ones at the store during any given year in the past.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 6:57 PM",Yes,"And I can't specifically remember the bad ones. That could be either because I'm wrong, or because I paid no mind to them. lol"
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 6:59 PM",No,I suppose I meant that there aren't any good new games coming out. So it's the same games I've seen for years. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:02 PM",Yes,Can't argue there.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:02 PM",Yes,I did end up getting the logo game.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:03 PM",Yes,I don't recall anything cool coming out this year or last year.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:02 PM",No,You're going to have quite the treasure trove of games!
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:04 PM",Yes,Haha it's nothing compared to my retired video games collection.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:04 PM",No,I'm sure!
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:05 PM",Yes,I was tempted to while out battleship last night. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:05 PM",Yes,When was the last time you played that?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:09 PM",No,Last week with my son haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:09 PM",Yes,*whip
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:09 PM",Yes,Really? Aw man.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:10 PM",Yes,I wish I had little people to play games with lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:10 PM",Yes,I guess I'll have kris when he moves in...
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:11 PM",Yes,Wait. Not to poke at his height or anything.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:11 PM",Yes,I mean someone to play games with.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:27 PM",No,Hahaha you can borrow my little people sometime. They like games haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 7:41 PM",Yes,I know you tend to lean towards the word and logic games. What genres of games do they like?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:42 PM",No,"They love Clue and Guess Who?, basically the interactive games like that. Caeden loves playing chess. Kailani likes Life. They just like to have fun and get attention haha"
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:46 PM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:46 PM",No,They also like drawing on me. Playing with my hair. Or doing my makeup. Caeden likes picking out my outfits for work too haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 7:46 PM",No,They enjoy being silly and creative
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:14 PM",Yes,I love Clue. There was a special version of Clue that they made a while back. I think it was called Clue Master. My sister took it with her when she left. I don't think they make it anymore. But I would like to get a copy of it. I'm sure I could find one on ebay if I looked. They sound like a fun bunch.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:25 PM",No,I try to keep things fun 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:25 PM",Yes,"Kids are amazing. They remind me of all the things I used to do to keep myself entertained. I was never bored at a young age. I would always be making something out of Legos or Knex. And I still do like to do projects, I just don't get to do them as often because of time and money. One thing that hasn't changed is my love for day dreaming, Haha. I actually don't know if I've shared this with anyone. But I can sit around for long periods of time doing nothing but playing out a story, simulating different scenarios, or just imagining myself in day to day interactions with people I know. Is that odd?"
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:25 PM",No,No. I do the same thing. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:27 PM",No,And I have conversations with myself when talking through a situation or an issue. But each side will literally have a different voice. I'll give them different accents and all that haha. I've never told anyone that before...
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:27 PM",No,I feel like that's probably weirder than daydreaming though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:31 PM",Yes,"Haha that's amazing. I do something similar, just not with two voices. Only one."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:32 PM",Yes,The daydreaming isn't so weird. It's the amount of time I spend doing it.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Sometimes it'll be three or four voices hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,"When I do speak out loud to work something out, I usually just talk as if I'm actually speaking to someone, God, or more recently my friend Anna. And usually make faces at them."
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:36 PM",No,And maybe you'll get to the point where you've got a lot more on your plate and you'll spend less time daydreaming? 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,That's a lot of voices to manage at once!
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:36 PM",No,Hahaha I can keep track
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:37 PM",Yes,I'll make time for daydreaming. It keeps me sane lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:38 PM",No,Hahaha I understand what you mean
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:38 PM",No,I'm meaning to say that maybe your thoughts will be occupied in a different way at some point
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:40 PM",Yes,Im not sure if I'm following what you're trying to tell me.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:41 PM",Yes,Thinking about... Work or family?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:50 PM",No,"Yeah. At some point you'll have the things you're daydreaming about now, so your thoughts will then probably move from daydreams to appreciating the life you have. "
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:50 PM",No,I don't even know if that's still the right way to convey what I mean though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,=)
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,I understand that.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:50 PM",No,Okay haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:50 PM",No,I tried
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:51 PM",Yes,*understood
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:52 PM",No,Hopefully you see that as a good change though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:55 PM",Yes,I would not mind living my daydreams.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 8:56 PM",Yes,Well some... A select few can can be life threatening and  violent at times.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 8:57 PM",No,"Then work on making your dreams a reality. The good ones, anyway..."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,Haha I had a dream last night. You and I were driving an RV to Florida lol. Just my brain processing the day.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:00 PM",Yes,But I'm really bad at driving in dreams so I ended up sending the RV over a cliff.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:01 PM",Yes,And I felt really horrible because it was yours.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:03 PM",Yes,You weren't in it though while I was driving. I had left you to go get gas. And I fell out before it flew off the edge.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:04 PM",Yes,So no injuries.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:05 PM",No,Well that's good. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:05 PM",No,I've always wanted an RV
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:05 PM",No,And I love going on road trips. 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:05 PM",No,"So I'm okay with that dream. And hopefully I's be smart enough to have full coverage on it, so the wreck, while inconvenient, wouldn't be devastating. "
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:09 PM",Yes,"Haha, I'm sure you had some sort of policy for it. I would have asked if I had thought of it then lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:15 PM",Yes,I love road trips too. I think a big part is because I love driving. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be driving an RV though.(RV keeps autocorrecting to Arab o_O) My grandparents used to have one growing up. They offered to let me drive it around a parking lot when I was like 12. I turned them down because it made me feel uncomfortable. Something I want to do soooo bad is to get a sports pilots license and buy an ultralite trike. They're small open motorized aircraft that use a hang glider for wings. I want to drive out to Monument Valley and fly around there.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,Do you like flying?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:19 PM",No,Flying is in my family haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:19 PM",Yes,That's right!
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:19 PM",Yes,I knew that
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:19 PM",No,My grandfather designed airplanes. My dad built airplanes and had a small aircraft pilots license for years. 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:20 PM",No,Yeah haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:20 PM",No,I've never been in a two or four person aircraft before though. The smallest one I've been in seated 20 I think 
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:24 PM",Yes,"Most trikes are 1 and 2 people. I've never flow it one, but they look like they would be so amazing to fly. There's not much of a body's just a frame with seats and wheels. So you have a great field of view."
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:27 PM",No,That reminds me of the tv show Road to Avonlea. Which I'm sure you've never seen. It's set during the turn of the century around like 1905 or so. There's a bumbling nervous inventor who is the sweetest guy and he invents and builds an aircraft like a Trike. It's a hilarious episode. I grew up on that show. Very wholesome family fun haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:29 PM",No,I have the first three seasons out of the seven they made. It was on the Canadian version of the BBC back in the late 80s-early 90s
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:29 PM",No,Geez I'm old haha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",Yes,A flying machine!
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",Yes,Haha you're not old.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,Yup
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:36 PM",Yes,I looked it up. 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,"And yes, I'm old-ish at the very least"
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:36 PM",Yes,"Step away from that window child, you'll catch death. Lol"
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,Hahaha I love it!
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:36 PM",Yes,So does that make me old-ish-ish?
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:35 PM",No,They got into all kinds of hijinks
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 9:37 PM",No,"And no. There's decrepit, old, old-ish, young-ish, young, and infantile. You're young-ish. "
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:42 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 9:44 PM",Yes,I guess I just go by a different scale.
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,I'm guessing you went off to bed. Goodnight! Hope this doesn't wake you.
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:33 PM",No,"Oddly enough the ""different scale"" message was just delivered. "
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 10:35 PM",Yes,Hmm
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:35 PM",No,The reception in my place is spotty. 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:35 PM",No,It's rather frustrating. 
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:35 PM",No,"But yes, I'm off to bed anyway. Goodnight Andrew! Sleep well when it's your turn to low down. "
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:37 PM",No,* lie! Hahahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 22, 2014 10:37 PM",Yes,"Haha. Thank you, I'm currently practicing the set game. I'm getting better. Goodnight Jessie! Have wonderful dreams."
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Well practice does help with that game haha
+12103557887,"Sep 22, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Goodnight 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 1:58 PM",Yes,Am I supposed to read Buttercup's Baby?
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 1:58 PM",Yes,"Rather, is it worth reading?"
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 1:58 PM",No,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 1:58 PM",No,"I mean, you can. "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 1:58 PM",No,It's up to you. 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 1:59 PM",No,It was alright
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 2:03 PM",Yes,I'll save it for later. See I finished! Only took me like half the year right?
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 2:08 PM",Yes,The fellowship is waiting for me at home. The print quality makes me cringe though. I might have to go find another copy. For some reason reading bad print can make me nauseous.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 2:29 PM",No,What edition did you get? 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 2:29 PM",No,You can borrow mine. The print is pretty good. 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 2:31 PM",No,And yay for finishing! Did you enjoy it? Was it worth half a year of your life? Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 3:52 PM",Yes,"I'm not sure of the edition actually. That wasn't really on my mind at the time of purchase haha. Are there notable differences?\LF\LFAnd yes, it was worth it. I haven't enjoyed a book like that since I read the hobbit in high school."
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 4:00 PM",No,"There are differences, yes "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 4:00 PM",No,I read the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings every year for Christmas haha
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 4:17 PM",Yes,That is a lot. I guess if I start now I could finish with you by Christmas of 2017.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 4:17 PM",Yes,lol. What kind of differences?
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 4:17 PM",No,Hahaha

+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 4:17 PM",No,Some of the editions have pictures. Or forewords. Letters from the author or publisher. The print is different. Sometimes there will be literary essays evaluating different aspects of the work. It just really depends. 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 4:25 PM",Yes,Are there ever any major changes to the primary text?
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 4:44 PM",Yes,Nothing in the book is standing out to me specifically as an edition.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 4:47 PM",Yes,"I happened across the amazon reviews for this specific release of the Fellowship. Some of these are quite funny. ""I got this novel because the movie rocked, but it sucked...Whoever wrote this should have paid more attention to the script"""
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:19 PM",No,Hahahaha yeah that's typical of illiterate snobs 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:19 PM",No,The text shouldn't change much. But the publishers have changed over the years. 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 5:20 PM",Yes,Well I wasn't sure if that. Or satirical.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:19 PM",No,"It may have been, yes"
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:19 PM",No,In fact or probably was

+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 5:21 PM",Yes,There were a few bad reviews that were super obviously satires.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:26 PM",No,That's typically how it goes with the English elitists hahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:27 PM",No,We are a snobby bunch. But we make it hard for others to catch on haha
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:28 PM",No,Maybe I shouldn't include myself in that group lol
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 5:28 PM",Yes,Haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 5:38 PM",Yes,I wouldn't classify you as snobby.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 5:38 PM",Yes,Definitely passionate lol. But not snobby.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 5:38 PM",No,I'll take passionate haha
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:10 PM",No,But unfortunately I can be very picky which can sometimes come off as somewhat snobby
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:12 PM",Yes,Picky? Can I get an example?
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:17 PM",No,"Hmmmm food, movies, books, clothes, Hahahaha "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:17 PM",No,Pretty much everything.

+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:25 PM",Yes,Ah gotcha. Yeah I'm typically the same way. But I'm more willing to try new things for certain people.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:25 PM",Yes,Maybe it's a subconscious display of trust.
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:25 PM",Yes,Or submission haha.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:28 PM",No,Yeah I can see that. I'm probably the same way. I can't tell you how many people had offered me balsamic vinaigrette or pesto before. You were the first who I said yes to. 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:31 PM",Yes,"Well that makes me feel pretty special! And I probably would have continued on my life never having held a moth before if I hadn't have met you, especially one that BIG!"
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:33 PM",Yes,So thanks for driving me to step a little farther out of my comfort bubble.

+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:34 PM",No,Hopefully we'll be able to continue to push eachother to try new things
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:52 PM",Yes,Oh I intend to. lol
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:53 PM",Yes,I'm guessing it's probably too soon to get you to try a tuna Oreo Dorito sandwich? Haha 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:53 PM",No,Uhhhhhh it may be too soon for the rest of my life Hahahahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:55 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:55 PM",No,I've never eaten tuna. So pairing that with the other stuff would certainly be too much for me. 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 6:55 PM",No,Would you ever eat one of my apple pies? 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 6:59 PM",Yes,"That's right, I remember you telling me that. Is there a reason behind your lack of tuna consumption? And with regards to your apple pie, I would definitely try some. However you have to promise not to be disheartened if I can't handle it."
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 7:21 PM",No,"I just really can't handle the overwhelming fish smell. I grew up in a fishing community and the smell always bothered me. I eat fish, but only really tame smelling ones like Halibut, Cod, or Sea Bass. Basically the white flaky fishes. And I've never eaten shellfish before. I have had shrimp, but that's it. No crab, lobster, clam, mussels, octopus, squid, etc. All because of the fish smell. \LF\LFAnd I can't believe you'd actually try the pie! You made it seem like that was totally out of the question. It wouldn't hurt my feelings. "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 7:21 PM",No,"If you couldn't handle it, that is. "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 8:15 PM",No,"Oh, FYI I found out today that there will be a position opening up in the data processing an computer programming department of the school district in December. For sure. Maybe even more than one. "

+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 8:16 PM",No,"*more than one position, I mean"
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 8:19 PM",Yes,"Omg, most fish smells I don't like. But I love canned/packaged tuna. Everytime I eat it I take very large whiffs of the packaging before I throw it away. It's a bit ritual now.\LF\LFI don't eat other fish very often. My parents like fish. And I'll eat if it's what someone has prepared for me. But I don't actively seek it. I do really enjoy shrimp though. Especially the smaller ones.\LF\LFI have eaten lobster and crab before, but they didn't seem to have much of a flavour at all, at least nothing I considered good.\LF\LFI have eaten clam chowder; gross. I've considered trying octopus, but am afraid to. Same goes for eel.\LF\LFAnd I would try the pie for you. But I seriously soft fruit is soooo challenging to swallow."
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 8:22 PM",Yes,Hmm do you think it would be listed on the website you pointed me at? I checked a while back and didn't see anything like that. The only computer position I saw was some sort of teaching position.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 8:23 PM",No,"It will be listed in December. And I can keep an eye out in the meantime. They have a  research analyst position currently posted, but you'd have to be done with school already for that one. I'll keep a lookout for you though. "
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,"That would be awesome, do they hire students fresh off the college press?"
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 8:33 PM",No,Yessir
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 8:34 PM",No,"Not for the major jobs, no. But my boss got hired right after school and within 7 years he became the Director for our department. And he doesn't even do all that much haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 8:58 PM",Yes,"Aww man, I was so set on being the boss of everything. =P  Well it's good to hear about another option. I've been a bit anxious thinking about what I'm going to do after school. "
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 8:58 PM",Yes,What was he doing when he was first hired?
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:06 PM",No,"He was hired as a CRMS manager. Which probably makes no sense to you haha but he was in charge of keeping track of all the assets in the district. Computers, tvs, electronics, furniture, etc. And then when it was time to get rid of any assets he was in charge of auctioning them off. "
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:06 PM",No,He had no experience in the area either. 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:07 PM",No,He just lucked out and interviewed well I guess. 
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 9:10 PM",Yes,Haha sounds like it.
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:12 PM",No,Sometimes that's all it takes 
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:35 PM",No,"Well, I'm heading to bed. Goodnight Andrew! Sleep well tonight"
+17069923021,"Sep 23, 2014 9:37 PM",Yes,Thank you. Goodnight Jessie. Don't forget to check for the creepy crawlies. =)
+12103557887,"Sep 23, 2014 9:37 PM",No,Already done haha night
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 1:21 PM",Yes,"So the other night while playing the set game, you mentioned something about starting on the hardest difficulty. Are there other ways to play it? Or a different deck of cards with less combinations?"
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,Also I have your Ferris Bueller disc. 
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 1:24 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:29 PM",No,The easiest level is playing with only all the cards which are vertical. So only three factors are considered. Then you add in the rest of the cards for orientation to be a fourth factor. \LF\LFAnd I totally wasn't thinking about the disc! Whoops! I read today that there's a free showing of Ferris Beuller at one of the theaters in SA this week and I was thinking that it was too bad we watched it on Sunday cause it would've been fun to see it in the theater. And that Lego set is totally cool!
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:29 PM",No,*Bueller
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:31 PM",No,"And there's another deck as well. I just didn't find that one in time. The factors on that one are shape, color, amount (1,2,3), and shading/pattern. "
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 1:37 PM",Yes,"What?? Showing it in the theatre? When? Which one?\LF\LFOk, oh that shading and quantity one must be the one I saw online. I don't like that one lol. Playing it makes me want to make a computer game version of it. But I don't have time for that right now. Maybe I can mess around with that next week."
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:56 PM",No,"Sorry, I had to look it up again. It's tomorrow night at 7 at the Bijou Theater. "
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:57 PM",No,I actually like the other one a little better. It's easier to get the concept of the game for some reason. Maybe because of the whole confusion with the orientation and such. 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 1:57 PM",No,Would you really make a computer game? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 2:04 PM",Yes,I am definitely considering it. I would like to have all my projects posted on my personal site so that employers and/or newbies can see my code. Are you familiar with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle? I wrote a computer game version of that. Everything but the sounds made from scratch. 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:07 PM",No,No I don't know what that is. I'll have to look it up. I can't even begin to understand how someone would go about doing something like that - writing code and developing programs. You amaze me. 
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 2:15 PM",Yes,"Haha, I didn't understand either until I finally jumped into it lol. But thank you. I'll show it to you next time you're over."
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:16 PM",No,I probably still wouldn't understand it though haha
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:16 PM",No,I just can't wrap my head around stuff like that very easily
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 2:18 PM",Yes,"Oh I mean I'll show you the game haha. Not the innards, unless you're curious."
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:18 PM",No,Oh I know what you meant hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:19 PM",No,I was continuin off of you saying you didn't get it at first either 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:19 PM",No,*continuing
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:20 PM",No,"I was saying that, unlike you, even after jumping into it I probably still wouldn't understand it"
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 2:21 PM",Yes,Oh lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 2:23 PM",Yes,"I'm sure you would grasp it well, given the same amount of time I've spent swimming in it; Especially with mind like yours. However I can't say whether you would enjoy it as much as I do though."
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 2:26 PM",No,Hahaha I think our minds are very different. Not in a bad way or anything. You seem to be able to think in both logical and abstract terms at the same time. I don't think I have the ability to do that. Word problems are very difficult for me. I just don't seem to be able to think in those terms. 
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 4:06 PM",Yes,Abstract and Logical terms at the same time? Did you have a particular example that brought you to that conclusion? I'm not sure I understand what you mean by that.\LF\LF\LF\LF
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 4:07 PM",Yes,Oops. Didn't mean to send all that white space. I wasn't done typing lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 4:15 PM",Yes,And I think everyone has trouble with word problems lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 4:19 PM",No,"Well, developing a computer program is an example. So abstract thinking in that you are able to take an idea in it's entirety and break it down to the simplest concept of origin and then follow a logical conclusion in how to get that concept to the full form you would like to produce. Does that make more sense? That you're able to see a root source for something from a larger picture. Like those puzzles you do. I can't ever figure things like that out because I'm not able to analyze the shapes in a way which informs a solution to solving a problem. I would never be able to solve a Rubix cube. "
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 4:20 PM",No,I'm not able to bridge the gap between my visual thinking skills and my logic and reasoning skills. 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 4:20 PM",No,"I'm strong in both areas, but have difficulty using them together. "
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 5:30 PM",Yes,"Hmm, I guess I've just been taking that for granted. But I now recall I used to have a lot of trouble with abstraction in my first year of school. It's a dilemma many programming students face when they are presented with the concept of something called object oriented programming. Which is a really cool subject, but summing it up in a text is not really feasible.\LF\LFI have to disagree with the Rubik's cube though. Other puzzles? yes. But the Rubik's cube is completely teachable. I'm almost certain 99.9999% of the people that know how to solve a Rubik's cube, were taught how to do so. It really only requires minimal spatial reasoning and the ability to memorize 6 sequences of turns, the longest of which is only 8 turns. Which I'm sure wouldn't be a challenge for you. You have elephant memory. =P That being said, if you WERE ever interested in learning it, I would so teach you, just sayin'. lol Can you tell I love Rubik's cubes?\LF\LFI guess we all have our strong points. You have a very encyclopedic mind and are usually able to formulate responses very quickly. I'll be honest. I used to be a bit jealous of that."
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 5:34 PM",No,Jealous of my fast responses? 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 5:34 PM",No,"I guess I do have the ability to think quickly on my toes, but they're not always the best choices haha"
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 5:36 PM",No,I can be incredibly impulsive. Which has gotten me into hot water before. 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 5:36 PM",No,And I think the thought process for me was very much learned through all of the reading I did. And that I'm able to store things into my memory well. 
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 5:36 PM",No,When were you jealous of my quick thinking? Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 6:37 PM",Yes,"Not just your response time, but the fact that you know so many things, your vast vocabulary, and the experiences you'd had. When we had first started spending time together after you left Target; having discussions over lunch and such. I would sometimes feel a little jealous and a bit(just a smidgen) intimidated by you. I think because many of your strengths are very easily noticeable. Especially because you communicate so well vocally. A short conversation with you is all that is needed to tell you are quite learned. Whereas the topics I am most fluent with rarely come up in conversation; so rarely in fact that I often forget I know them at all lol, which can lead me to feel intimidated/jealous. So... sorry for being jealous at first.\LF\LFNow rather, I'm just continually impressed. And I use what was once my jealousy, to motivate myself to improve myself; I guess sorta ""as iron sharpens iron, so shall man sharpen man."" The things that I admire about you, inspire me to strengthen those areas in my life through practice. Is that a reasonable answer? Haha"
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 7:00 PM",No,"Much more of one than I thought I would get haha. I thought you meant there was a specific time I had done something to make you jealous. But what you expressed was a better answer than I deserve. \LF\LFI don't mean to be intimidating at all. Maybe I just don't guard my thoughts well. Or I'm too blunt or open too quickly. I've gotten feedback from people, and maybe they didn't have my best interests at heart, which made it clear that I come off like a know-it-all. And that's completely unintentional on my part. All I try to do is share what I've learned with others because I think it's interesting, not at all because I'm trying to jam it down their throat. \LF\LFAdditionally, almost everyone I know well has shared with me that I intimidated them at the beginning. This is a hard concept for me to grasp because I don't try to make people scared of me at all. I try, rather, to be as friendly and supportive as possible. I guess I don't show that in the right ways initially. I know I'm awkward, and I don't understand people easily, but I also know that I mean incredibly well. So even though I've heard the intimidation factor before, it still always surprises me. \LF\LFI'm thankful that we've moved past that though. And I hope that I don't continue to make you feel intimidated or uncomfortable. Especially because I feel so at ease with you. I find our conversations incredibly refreshing, and I am always so delighted that you are willing to be open with me and share your thoughts and feelings as much as you do. I find great value in this. \LF\LFFor whatever reason you have, for some time now, been able to break through a lot of the walls I keep up with most people and I have surprised myself with some of the things I've shared with you. Not in a bad way, it's definitely been a good thing. So I feel like you're doing me quite a lot of good too. "
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 9:19 PM",Yes,"I'm sorry that people have been intimidated by you. I'm sure that's not the most pleasant of feelings. But it's no fault of your own though. There's a responsibility for others to see you, not to perceive you. Other people must be willing to resist the temptation to judge your character by relating your behavior to their past experiences. Sadly that happens a lot between us humans. I know I'm guilty of it.\LF\LFThe ironic thing in my case was that the same things that intimidated me at first, intrigued me at the same time. Many of the things you are knowledgable of, such as movies, books, lore, language, etc, are passions of mine that I, for various reasons, have not spent as much time in as I would have liked. Thus the seed of my jealousy. But I knew that that, along with the intimidation factor, were both self generated. And I knew that you weren't doing anything intentional to foster those feelings of course. You had never shown me any reason to think that.\LF\LFI'm glad you feel at ease with me, that makes me feel safe. That might sound like an odd causation, but I'm sure there is some reasoning behind it lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 24, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,And I have definitely pushed my limits since I've met you. You're quite the motivator.
+12103557887,"Sep 24, 2014 9:33 PM",No,"I'm glad the intimidation never came off as purposeful on my part. I'm always very conscious of not making people want to think negatively of me, or have a bad experience because of me. \LF\LFSafe is a good word. And I think I can relate to that sense. Maybe comforted is another good word to describe that general feeling? Being comforted in the ease of things? Not having to worry about whether or not someone else is being genuine and if they feel relaxed and secure? I'm not sure if that's the same as what you're describing, but that's the sense I get from the word ""safe"". \LF\LFI never saw myself as a motivator. So that's  intriguing to me. Thank you for sharing all of this. It has generated a nice, fuzzy feeling haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 7:14 PM",Yes,=) Just like Grozarra.

+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 7:46 PM",No,That would be correct sir
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 7:47 PM",No,It's his most famous sonnet. 
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 7:48 PM",No,And he did everything in iambic pentameter. 
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 7:48 PM",No,His plays are dizzying. That level of mastery of language is completely lost today. Unfortunately. 
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 7:51 PM",Yes,I remember how complicated it was. Our teacher made us write our own. 
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 7:53 PM",No,"I had to do that exercise many times over the years. Ah, the trials of an English major..."
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 8:01 PM",No,"Dissecting his sonnets was very interesting though. Several of them appear to be full of adulations for his lover, but upon gaining a better understanding of the types of puns he used, the end result is actually a  series of biting and sarcastic quips about how much he can't stand his lover. "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Not something you enjoyed?
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 8:30 PM",Yes,So he had sass.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 9:01 PM",No,"I enjoyed it, but I had a great amount of difficulty doing it. Poetry which follows specific rules within the stanzas doesn't flow easily for me. I can write free form poetry ver quickly, as I'm sure most people can, but anything else takes me way too long. \LF\LFAnd yes, he had more sass than he knew what to do with. His plays are absolutely hilarious! Of course, much of the wit is now lost in translation, but what we do know for certain is that he was a master at his craft!"
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,Do you do write free form poetry much in your spare time?
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 9:06 PM",Yes,I still have your Blue one.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 9:34 PM",Yes,"I feel so weird packing by myself. Everytime I've ever relocated, I've always had my parents with me."
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 9:40 PM",No,"You saved it? Haha I didn't expect that at all. Honestly, that was the first poem I had written in years. Many, many years. And I don't know why I wrote it either. I just felt compelled to, I guess. I've found some of the other stuff I had written over the years during this arduous unpacking process, but the ones I have found seem somewhat silly to me. Probably because I was writing them in the height of my adolescence when I thought the world revolved around me haha\LF\LFHow is the packing going anyway? Will you able to finish quickly? I find moving to be such a hassle. It's exciting because of having a new place, which then feels like you're starting a new journey to some degree, but the packing and unpacking is so stressful. I don't think I've ever had an easy move before. And I've moved countless times. "
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 9:40 PM",No,*be able to
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 9:59 PM",Yes,"I thought it was beautiful. In fact I think that was my response when you sent it haha. I was moved.\LF\LFThe packing is going... That is all lol. I'm feeling very anxious, I was so swamped the past two days with homework I was just barely able to finish my assignments before I had to turn them in. Now I have another one due tomorrow that I have to finish. So the move is just the cherry on top. I've actually occasionally had nightmares about moving. I have to leave, but I'm not finished. And it's just constant pressure. Sorry I'm being a little stress ball. I'll just be super glad when this is all over and I can sit in an apartment that is in order."
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 9:59 PM",Yes,"But yup, I kept it."
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 10:03 PM",Yes,And look what I found... ￼Would you like some ciabatta?
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 10:05 PM",No,"Don't apologize. I know exactly what you're going through. And I'm still unpacking! It is extremely nervewracking! And you have a lot of other stuff going on too, between work and school. I wish I could be of some help, but I know there's probably very little I could do to alleviate your stress at this point. It will all work out okay though. Just focus on school, then the move, then work, and before you know it you'll be in your new place and carrying on the same as before. Try not to be too worried about it, or you'll find yourself in a vicious stress cycle which will take a long time to get out of. \LF\LFI'm glad one of us kept it, because it got deleted from my phone when I reset my settings a while back trying to fix some network issues. I don't even remember what started me off on that poem, but I do remember writing it and editing it like I was turning in an assignment or something lol\LF\LFAnd that is one black piece of bread! Did you turn your oven on and smell something strange? I'm not even there and I'm stinking the place up lol"
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 10:17 PM",Yes,"Actually just messaging with you is comforting in and of itself. You're very distracting, lol, in a good way; it gets my mind off the stresses so in can focus on just getting things done. *deep breath*\LF\LFAnd regarding the poem. I think I had asked you what your favourite color was and/or why it was your favourite color. And I'll be darned if I ever forget what your favourite color is after reading that. I could tell you put a lot of work into into it.\LF\LFThe bread was in the oven the entire time I was cooking the fries. 25 minutes at 450 degrees actually. I kept smelling a hint of something smoky, but I assumed it was the oil. Ive never deep fried anything before so I thought maybe the smell was from that. And in didn't find it till just now when I was checking to see if the oven was going to need a lot of work."
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 10:18 PM",Yes,"You have work tomorrow, are you headed to the sack soon?"
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 10:19 PM",Yes,And I'm having to do all the packing in my room so I don't wake the baby! ￼
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 10:29 PM",No,"Well I'm glad I can be a healthy diversion then haha\LF\LFOh, I remember what you asked me haha I meant that I don't remember what made me feel that surge of creativity. I could have just said ""blue"" like a normal person hahaha but instead I had to go full beat poet and wear all black with a slanted beret and stand under a spotlight while snapping my fingers to the rhythm of my own elevated thoughts. I was honestly afraid after I sent it that I would come off looking like such an artistic snob. You know, the ones who you roll your eyes at because they're so self-important and egotistical. I didn't want it to seem that way, so I was relieved when you seemed to read it as the outpouring of my honest thoughts in the way I intended it to be. I don't think I was really able to thank you for that, for being so kind with my quirkiness. It made me feel very valued and like I didn't have to be afraid to share the true me. \LF\LFI'm taking the day off tomorrow, more than likely, because Kailani came home from school and started developing a fever. I'm pretty sure it's just allergies, but they can't go to school if they've had a fever in the last 24 hours. \LF\LFHaha oh Kris! I'm sure he's looking forward to being able to sleep in a bed again! Is he already packed? "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 10:36 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Hahahahaha pretty much
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 10:39 PM",No,Gotta love those Goofs! 
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:04 PM",Yes,"I've never gotten a big ego vibe from you before, so I didn't really have a reason to think you were. I was just felt touched that you expressed yourself like that.\LF\LFOh no! Poor girl. I'm sorry. Those are typically not fun. Last Christmas before I had left for Seattle, my friend Phil and Jordan came to visit me. Kris came over as well. Kris was sick and I caught something from him. The following weeks were awful. I had a fever on and off. And I felt so bad not being able to do much with them. I hardly remember anything from that week. Phil will tell me stuff even now, and it'll be news to me. I hope she feels better."
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:06 PM",Yes,He is packed. He said he only had a few things.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:06 PM",Yes,I went into work today just to pick up boxes. I got so many. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,I raided the bailer and found some stuff left over from flow.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:09 PM",No,"Part of being a kid is getting sick. She'll be just fine. Typically she will sleep for an entire day and then be good to go from there. But thanks for the well wishes! \LF\LFI'm glad he's ready, I was gonna say you should kick him out if he wasn't done! Haha\LF\LFHaving boxes at hand like that is always helpful. Most of my stuff was still boxed from when I put it into storage a year ago, so I only had to get a few additional boxes what I had unpacked while at my mom's. Were you able to get the weekend off to move? Or are you having to work during the craziness? "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,I'm always off Sunday. And Saturday I just have an 8-1am shift. So I'll be able to get some stuff done before work. Sunday is the actual move in day so I'll have a day to transfer stuff. And I have my old apartment through Monday and Tuesday for backup.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:13 PM",Yes,So happy about that. I would have been a wreck if I had to work on move in day.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:15 PM",Yes,Matt requested Sunday off too so the three of us will be moving stuff. So blazed to have caring friends. =D
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:15 PM",Yes,*blessed! lol blessed!
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:17 PM",No,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:17 PM",No,Definitely blessed!
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:18 PM",No,And having the extra four days of overlap between units will really make a ton of difference in your stress levels. So that's good!
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Sometimes I'll chuckle when I walk by my soft lights. I remember when you asked me if I used them for growing things. And for some reason I thought you were talking about growing weed.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Hahahaha no no no
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Herbs!
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:19 PM",No,"Well, more specifically, basil, parsley, thyme, etc. "
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:19 PM",No,That still came out wrong lol
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,Hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:20 PM",Yes,I really want to grow a basil plant. Zomg they smell so good.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:20 PM",No,I would never see you as someone involved in illegal drugs and the growing and distribution of said paraphenalia
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:21 PM",No,Fresh basil is rather fantastic
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:21 PM",No,Mint too
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:21 PM",No,"Or rather, mint is as well"
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:22 PM",No,"I would like to have a vegetable garden again. I had them, and rather large ones too, all the time as a child, but they're so hard to maintain in this climate. "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,"When my brother and sister in law moved in they started a nice garden in our yard; basil, mint, rosemary, and my favourite, ghost peppers!"
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:28 PM",Yes,Of course the chilis weren't kept with the other plants lol. We had a separate very large lot for that one.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,And at the same time I had bought a basil plant and let it grow very large. We ended up making a nice pesto from it.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,You are just a jack of all trades aren't you.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:30 PM",Yes,I'm typically not very good with plants. I thinks it's a curse I've inherited from my mother.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:30 PM",No,"Hahaha am I? I don't see it that way at all. I was just raised differently from most other people so I was encouraged to try a lot of different things. But they're all creative things in one way or another. And look at you though, aren't you the one who has tried all kinda of things too? Talk about a jack of all trades haha"
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:32 PM",No,"I have a fair amount of talents, I suppose. But only because I was raised to explore many things. "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,I feel like my all hobbies and talents are fairly obscure though.
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:36 PM",Yes,And definitely not a useful lol. I can't make a delicious dish by spinning poi or solving a Rubik's cube lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:37 PM",No,"How are they obscure? They may be varied, but there's nothing wrong with that at all. "
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:37 PM",No,"And if I recall, you're very skilled in the kitchen. So you had better be including that as a talent. "
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:38 PM",Yes,Well... Baking here and there I guess. Nothing compared to you though! Sweet mercy woman! you can cook lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Hahaha can I?
+12103557887,"Sep 25, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Those creme puffs were certainly impressive!
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:53 PM",Yes,"No I suppose there is nothing wrong with that. I think I secretly kinda like it though. Cause i can teach people about them. I got my friend into spinning poi a few years ago. He was really bad at first... Really bad. He would get discouraged. But I kept pushing him really hard. He kept it up. I lost contact with him for a while. He was the guy that went nomad for a while. When he got back on the grid i found out he had kept up with it. He's really good now. He spins fire now though. Whereas I spin glowsticks. Haha I can't do fire because the moves I do require a lot of contact with the leashes. And when your spinning fire the leases are like a million degrees lol.\LF\LFThank you! I think I ate two that night! I'm such a piggy haha. And yes you can cook very well. Haha I think I was trying to hold back any food moans lol, not sure if I let any slip though haha. I didn't want to weird you out."
+17069923021,"Sep 25, 2014 11:54 PM",Yes,You let me know if you need to go to bed though ok? Otherwise you know I'll just go on yapping.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:02 AM",No,"Well, be proud of your abilities then! And don't demean the work your put into learning new things by saying they aren't useful. Clearly they were useful for your friend. I'm sure you'll continue to find uses for them in the years to come.  As well as uses for the many more hobbies you will explore and talents you will acquire. I don't see you giving up teaching yourself new things any time soon, and that's fantastic! \LF\LFTo be fair to myself, you've only ever eaten two of my pasta dishes. What if that's all I can cook? Hahaha and no, I didn't hear any food moans hahaha. There's no way it could have been that good though. You must have just been really hungry lol"
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:09 AM",No,"I just got Kailani back down to bed now and should probably head to my own. I've still got to get Caeden up in the morning for school as bright and early as always. Thank you for being concerned for my sleep habits, and as much as I don't want to cut off the conversation for tonight, I probably need to. Good luck with the packing and try to remain as stress-free as possible. Text me when you have the time, I don't want to get in the way of you having a successful move. Goodnight Andrew! "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:15 AM",Yes,"You've got a point. It's become a pretty big part of him. And has helped him in with dealing with some of the not so fun things in life. He's Anna's brother; my friend who passed last year. I'm very close with their whole family. I'm proud to have shared that skill with him.\LF\LFHaha yes I realize that I've only eaten two things you've prepared, but they were soooooo good! Totally worthy of food moans!\LF\LFOk ok. I know! Sleep's important! I can't help but be concerned with your well being. Haha ok I'll shutup now lol. Sleep well tonight Jessie!"
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:16 AM",No,I will Andrew. And you sleep well also! 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:56 AM",No,￼Since I know fan of both...
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:56 AM",No,*you're a fan of both
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:56 AM",No,Wow. That was dumb. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:57 AM",Yes,That's no moon!
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:58 AM",Yes,Haha good morning. I haven't seen that one before. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:57 AM",No,I've got a bad feeling about this...
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:57 AM",No,Morning!
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:59 AM",No,I like how they're both drinking beer. I would've taken Boba Fett to be more of a moonshine type of guy. And Vader definitely drinks hardcore Russian vodka! 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:03 PM",Yes,"I love how you've thought this scenario out, haha. Boba yes, but Vader and vodka? I think he would be more of a fruity mixed drink. He's a softy that has trouble expressing himself."
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:04 PM",No,But that uniform! Hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:04 PM",No,And vodka can be mixed with cranberry juice for when he feels like opening up and letting his feelings out. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:06 PM",No,And I'm certain that he wouldn't have any difficulty ordering a vodka-cranberry or vodka sour. They're still manly enough if you go heavy on the vodka hahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:06 PM",No,"He may be a softy, but so are Russians, deep down. "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:10 PM",Yes,"Ok... I just asked Matt what type of alcohol Vader would drink. I did not tell him my thoughts or what you had said. He said, ""I figure Vader for a Jack and Coke kind of guy. He definitely doesn't drink vodka."""
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:10 PM",Yes,Ok vodka with skmething.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:10 PM",Yes,I'll take that. lol
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:10 PM",Yes,But it has to be sweet.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:12 PM",No,Jack and Coke would imply he smokes as well. People who drink Jack and Coke also smoke. And Vader doesn't smoke. Fire near his body makes him nervous. Especially after the lava accident. That's why he never learned the lighting trick. Too much heat for him to handle. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:13 PM",No,*lightning
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:13 PM",No,My phone is being difficult today. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:15 PM",No,I feel like vodka is a no nonsense drink. And Vader is definitely not a fan of nonsense. Hence my reasoning for vodka. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:16 PM",No,"Then again, I wouldn't say that my experience with alcohol makes me an expert on this topic at all. "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:19 PM",Yes,I can't even. You're awesome. That's some very sound reasoning. I definitely am not sided with Matt and Kris(he sided with Matt) on this one.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:19 PM",Yes,"So as long as there is something fruity and sweet in his vodka, agree with you."
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:20 PM",No,"Hahaha and if there isn't something fruity and sweet, what then? Margaritas? Bwahahahahahaha"
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:21 PM",No,Strawberry Daquiris? Lol
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:22 PM",Yes,Appletinis of course. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:24 PM",No,Hahahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 12:25 PM",No,I knew you were going to say Martinis or some variant of that 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:53 PM",Yes,"Haha, Scrubs. Seemed fitting lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 12:54 PM",Yes,"This is sort of off topic, but who is narrating the prologue of The Fellowship? Concerning hobbits."
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:03 PM",No,Yeah I got the reference. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:03 PM",No,That would be the voice of Ian Holm. Bilbo in the LOTR series. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:05 PM",No,Interesting fact: BBC radio did a dramatization of The Lord of the Rings in the late 80s and Ian Holm was the voice of Frodo for that radio series. So he voiced Frodo for the radio and played Bilbo in the movies. I think that's super cool. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:05 PM",No,Are you watching the Fellowship right now?
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:10 PM",Yes,I meant in the book actually. Is Bilbo narrating it?\LF\LFDramatization? I wonder if there's a copy of that available somewhere. I'd like to give that a listen.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:13 PM",No,Ohhh Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:15 PM",No,"And yes, it's still Bilbo. The Hobbit and the prologue to LOTR are from Bilbo's perspective. LOTR is from Frodo's perspective. \LF\LFAnd I have the radio series, of course! You're welcome to borrow it. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:16 PM",No,The Concerning Hobbits section is the last bit Bilbo wrote before he handed off the red book to Frodo and left for Rivendell to be with the elves. The red book is what they wrote their adventures in.  
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:17 PM",No,Does that make sense? I may be going a bit Tolkien nerd...
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:22 PM",Yes,"There's no doubt about that. But it's not a bad thing. And yes that does make sense. I had a general sense of how the books worked, but wasn't 100% sure. I read it some on Tuesday."
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:25 PM",No,He wrote the Hobbit first. But it wasn't published until after The Lord of the Rings trilogy. So that had many people confused for quite some time. And then you throw The Silmarillion in the mix and people got even more confused lol
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:25 PM",No,"I quite like The Silmarillion, but many people find it too boring with not enough action. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:25 PM",No,I just read it like it's the Bible of Middle Earth and it makes so much more sense haha
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:27 PM",Yes,I didn't realize the hobbit was published later. Then again I'm definitely not a safe source for literary history.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:27 PM",Yes,Is it more of like a reference type book?
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:29 PM",No,"Not a reference so much as the creation/origin story for Middle Earth. And then there are many tales within that mix as well. So it really is almost like reading the Old Testament. Except it's Middle Earth and there are elves, dwarves, ents, huge spiders, wizards, and men who live unnaturally long lives. "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,Like pre third age?
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,Ok I think I get it.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:29 PM",No,Yes. From the very beginning of when their universe was created. It's a fun work of fiction to read with other people so that you can discuss what's happening. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:30 PM",No,Reading it on your own is much more difficult. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,I would love to take a look at that. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,A glance at least.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 1:33 PM",No,But it almost warrants a bible study type of reading haha\LF\LFI've got that book as well. The opening chapter is one of my favorites in all of the literature I've ever read. The concepts of language and the origins of sound he writes about are incredibly beautiful. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 3:36 PM",Yes,Just how large is your collection of books? Maybe I shouldn't have even asked that lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 3:38 PM",Yes,And is Kailani feeling better?
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 3:48 PM",No,"I used to have over 1,000 books. But I've downsized to about 500-600 or so over the last year and a half. Moving that many books is quite cumbersome. So I kept only books I had read more than once, or hadn't read yet and was still intending to. The others I had read and not enjoyed as much or had grown out of, so to speak. There are still a great many books I would like to add to my eclectic little library though. \LF\LFKailani is going back and forth, and has been all day. A couple of hours ago her fever got to 103, but now it's at 100. So I dunno what's going on. I'm just hoping it's not strep. If she's not feeling better by tomorrow we'll go to the clinic. She didn't want to go to the doctor today, and I'm the weird parent who trusts their gut and their kids' input before rushing them to the physician. I feel like generally if she's REALLY not feeling well at all, both of us will know it and that's when we make a trip to the MD. It's always worked well for us in the past. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 3:49 PM",No,And thank you for thinking of asking. That was very nice. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,"Sorry I didn't respond for so long! I passed out on the couch while reading. Then Sarah woke me up because she needed the keys to her apartment and Matt left them with me. Which was good because I had to get ready for work. All that packing last night wore me out.\LF\LFThat's a lot of books. That's probably about what my dad has. He's got so many shelves of books. Most of them are psychology and psychotherapy books though. He does read novels, but not as often as the psych stuff. Then there's my little collection of books; mostly programming primers and textbooks.\LF\LFGosh, I hope she feels better. Has she been sleeping most of the day?"
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 8:18 PM",Yes,I dislike going to the doctors. I usually try to ride it out haha. But sometimes I'm not successful.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 8:35 PM",No,Well that's good that Sarah woke you up. Being late for work would have certainly stressed you out! \LF\LFI don't know that I have any more than maybe a dozen non-fiction books haha. Not counting my encyclopedia and dictionaries. \LF\LFAnd she's feeling a little better. But I'm pretty sure she's got strep and that it is going to be very quickly passed to Caeden and I. I'm planning on making a trip to the clinic tomorrow irregardless of how she feels. She's still running a fever too. But I'm sure everyone will be just fine within the next few days. And in the meantime I'm wrapping up the last details of unpacking. So progress is still being made! 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 9:58 PM",Yes,No more than a dozen? And I bet they're all history no? \LF\LFAnd yay for being almost finished unpacking! I've still got a bit to go haha. I'll be working on that tomorrow before work. My room is done and almost everything in my living room is done. Some of my kitchen.￼
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,Looks like Kris is being super helpful hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",Yes,Last night we went to go locate our apartments. Kris hadn't actually been to it yet. And we hadn't seen where Matt and Sarah were going to be living. When we got to ours we noticed the door was open!
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,And not history so much as literary and linguistic theory. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,Open?!
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,Yikes!
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:00 PM",Yes,If only his sleeping was productive. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:00 PM",Yes,Yes it was open!
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:00 PM",Yes,I walked up and peeked in.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 9:59 PM",No,Like unlocked open? Or just door wide open?
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,The door was open like an inch. I wanted to go inside and look around but I didn't want to do it alone. However no one would go with me because the I made a comment about how the carpet looked drenched with blood.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,Mind you this is at 1230? 1?
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,Am
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:03 PM",Yes,I did en up grabbing a flash light and looking up the stairs.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,The stairs were super dirty. I hope they worked on them either already today or tomorrow.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:05 PM",No,Hahaha your new place has a murderous history? That's creepy. 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:05 PM",No,Why did the carpet look bloody? That's kinda scary. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,On that comment reminded me of something.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,Just because it was pitch black.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:06 PM",No,Oh gotcha. But you freaked everyone else out huh?
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,You couldn't see anything. I just noticed several spots on the stairs haha.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,Yeah.. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:06 PM",Yes,So what you said about murderous history.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:07 PM",No,So you're just being conscious of the uncleanliness because it's about to be where you live? 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:07 PM",Yes,Yeah
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:07 PM",Yes,One of the places I lived in Georgia. I made the mistake of turning on my black it in the room. There were large puddle snapped splotches everywhere!
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,And only in my room!
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Nowhere else in the house.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Kind of unnerving.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:09 PM",No,"That's totally not cool. But, it could have been some other sort of fluid besides blood..."
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:09 PM",Yes,I know... Not sure if that makes me feel any better though... Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:10 PM",Yes,Someone just spilled some watered down UV paint.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:10 PM",Yes,I'll pretend that.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:09 PM",No,"Hey, I didn't specify *bodily* fluid. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:10 PM",No,I was thinking bleach or something. Maybe an intense cleaning product got spilled. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:19 PM",Yes,"Haha, neither did I!"
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:20 PM",No,Fine fine
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:22 PM",No,I suppose I should apologize for thinking inappropriate things
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,"You don't have to apologize for nothing. Just because I didn't specify, doesn't mean I wasn't thinking."
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,I think we're even there.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:29 PM",No,Hahahaha still...
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:35 PM",Yes,"Well in that case, I have to apologize too. Although is it reasonable to expect someone's brain to not have thought pop into their head?"
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:35 PM",Yes,Trying to not think of something rarely. works.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:38 PM",No,"I was just joking about the apologizing haha. We're both adults, that would naturally be the thing that comes to mind. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's just us being silly. "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:38 PM",Yes,Our brains continuously think of things whether we like it or not. Maybe the only reason we have mouths instead of communicating telepathically is so we can selectively share out thoughts.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 10:40 PM",Yes,Haha I'm missing your voice so occasionally I can't tell you're joking.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:40 PM",No,"Haha I was just typing a very similar argument. And yes, I think the mouth can definitely be used for filtering thoughts. Although not everyone used their mouths to help with that process and they often word vomit anyway. I can word vomit sometimes. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 10:42 PM",No,That's why I prefer talking over texting. Because my sarcasm and wittiness are often completely lost in a text. I'm so straightforward about things anyway...you can't always tell the difference between a real answer and one said in jest. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,It was quite a moment of epiphany.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,Or at least I felt that way. lol
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:10 PM",No,Hahaha I guess so 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:13 PM",Yes,Yeah.. That is the downside of texting.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:13 PM",Yes,Sometimes i wish calling people didn't make me so anxious.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:13 PM",No,Why does that make you anxious? 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:14 PM",Yes,I don't know. I'm sure there's some past experience that caused it.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:15 PM",Yes,I've been nervous about calling people as far as I can remember.
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:16 PM",Yes,It's kind a weird idiosyncrasy.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:17 PM",No,Did either of your parents talk much on the phone? 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Not abnormally.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:19 PM",No,My mom was on the phone all the time. That's probably why I'm so comfortable with it. 
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,"Yeah, it's weird. And it's a per person basis."
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:29 PM",Yes,On the plus side. I never call into work for any reason other than being sick.
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:28 PM",No,"Not with my mom. She can, and will, be on the phone for hours. "
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:30 PM",No,Because you aren't   comfortable using the phone? That's why you don't call in? 
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:30 PM",No,I don't really know what to aha about that. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:33 PM",No,"I keep nodding off though. So I should probably say goodnight for real. Good night Andrew! Sleep well, and good luck with waking up early to pack! "
+17069923021,"Sep 26, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,"Haha. And it's not the talking that makes me uncomfortable. It's solely the dialing. -_- I can't talk on the phone for hours too. In fact I've had Skype calls with people going on 6+ hours.\LF\LFAww man, I was driving so I wasn't able to respond right away hopefully this doesn't wake you if you did fall asleep again. A pleasant sleep to you Jessie, and I'll pray for you and your family's health K? Can't be getting sick now."
+12103557887,"Sep 26, 2014 11:44 PM",No,Thanks for the prayers. They're much appreciated. Night Andrew!
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:28 AM",Yes,*can talk on the phone for hours too.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 11:31 AM",No,"That makes more sense. I was a bit confused when I read your message last night. \LF\LFSo why does the dialing of the numbers make you nervous then, if the talking does not? "
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 11:32 AM",No,Thought you might like to know that Kailani says you look like Aragorn from LOTR haha
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 11:32 AM",No,"I think it's just the long hair and the beard, but who knows..."
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:34 AM",Yes,"""Ride hard... Don't look back..."""
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:34 AM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:37 AM",Yes,I don't mind when people tell me I look like someone. I usually think it's funny. Unless they're telling me i look like Jesus. That's the one that irks me. I had some guy come through my line last month asking me to forgive him because he had sinned...
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:38 AM",Yes,"Then I muster up the most sarcastic ""Ha! That is so funny."" I can manage. lol"
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:40 AM",Yes,Darian keeps calling me Steven Segal at work lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:42 AM",Yes,"And concerning the dialing of numbers, I'm just not sure."
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 11:43 AM",Yes,Did her fever finally break?
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 11:55 AM",No,"Steven Segal? Oh gosh no! That's almost insulting. Darian really used to get on my nerves sometimes.  Talk about not having a filter! \LF\LFI don't always like being told I look like other people. Mostly because I don't see the similarity at all. And when I try to ask why someone is telling me I look like Alanis Morisette, or Zooey Deschanel, they never want to tell me why they're making that connection. So it bothers me even more. If they could at least give me a reason, even if I don't agree with it, I'd be more okay with the comparison. But I guess I'm difficult. \LF\LFAnd Kailani certainly meant it as a compliment. Aragorn is one of her favorite characters. It surprised me when she said it though because she's only seen a photo of you once and it was your wind-blown shampoo commercial one haha. And when I asked why she thought you looked like him she said ""I dunno. They just look alike."" I asked if it was just because of the hair and the beard and she said ""no, it's more than that. His eyes seem kind."" \LF\LFHer fever broke in the wee hours of the morning and hasn't returned. Thank goodness. She's a bit cranky now, which means she's at least got the energy to muster up an attitude. But I'm not certain if that's a fantastic development. She can be pretty snippy when she's not feeling all that great, as I'm sure most people can be. But hopefully by tomorrow there will be a marked improvement. "
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 1:05 PM",Yes,"Well you don't look like Zooey. I think mostly people see connections or similarities in hair. Even if it's just one stupid thing. Like Steven Segal with long hair, simply because he had long hair. For you my guess would be, ""Oh, Jessie has bangs... So does Zooey deschanel. Therefore Zooey looks like Jessie."" I think that's why I find it funny, because of the absurdity of it. The ones I hear the most are Jesus, Shaun Whit, David Spade, and Zac Effron, all of which seem quite silly to me. \LF\LFSee, I like it when Darian says stupid stuff to me. But I can tell when he's just being an idiot. What I worry about is when he talks that way to other people. And they don't understand his... Darian-ness. I wanted to smack him one day when he was talking with Jim and I. He came off as extremely rude.\LF\LFOh! I got to see the new apartment today! I was going to the office just to get a status update, and the landlord called out to me from across the parking lot, ""Hey! Aren't you moving tomorrow?!"" She was doing final inspections and cleanings on a few places and asked if I wanted to go look at it. I am so excited. The ""blood"" on the carpet was gone, everything looked really nice. Sink fixtures were upgraded and the blinds were wooden; a step up from my place. I can't wait to start getting everything over there. I'm about to head to target and petsmart to get some things that'll help me with fish relocation.\LF\LFA bit of a crankster eh? Well you can tell Kailani thank you for the eye comment. That's prolly one of the sweetest things I've ever heard anyone say about me. I really like that picture haha, it was fun taking it!"
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 1:22 PM",No,"Yes. Those are all silly comparisons. And yeah, it's all about the hair. There have been people I've argued with about that before. That they're telling me I look like someone just  because of the bangs, and they always say ""no no it's more than that"", but then as soon as I show them a photo of me when I didn't have bangs, they no longer think I look like Zooey. It's kind of ridiculous. \LF\LFMy problem with Darian is exactly that he doesn't gauge who he's talking to and whether or not he's making them uncomfortable. Or rather, I think he does know when he's making someone uncomfortable but keeps pushing their buttons anyway. I can't tell you how many times he said something entirely inappropriate to me in front of other people and then I had to pull him aside and scold him for his behavior. To me that was too much babysitting of an adult. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind Darian on his own, but when he's in a group it always seemed to be a problem.  \LF\LFI'm excited for your new place and that it seems like there were no murders after all. Just don't use any black lights in there! Haha\LFBut that's good that everything is coming together for you, and that some of your stresses are being eliminated. I'm happy for you! \LF\LFAnd I'm sure people have told you nice things before. In fact, I know they have! But I'll let her know you appreciated the comment haha. Maybe it will pull her out of the funk she's currently in. Poor thing is definitely not feeling well. Her fever came back. Sigh. "
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 3:22 PM",No,￼

+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 3:44 PM",Yes,Do they fit alright? I'm not much of an expert on sock buying lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 3:45 PM",Yes,Did you guys end up going to the clinic?
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 3:49 PM",No,Socks are pretty much one size fits all haha \LFAnd they fit just fine thanks!\LF\LFWe didn't. I'll wait to see how she's feeling. I prefer to let her body fight it off as much as possible. 
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 3:53 PM",Yes,Is it just a fever? Or is she having other symptoms.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 3:54 PM",No,Pretty much just a fever and congestion. 
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 3:55 PM",No,Her throat is only sore from the drainage. 
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 4:00 PM",Yes,And she started feeling bad Thursday? Man being sick sucks so bad.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 4:02 PM",No,We've all been feeling off for a couple weeks now. With allergies and the weather change. I'm thinking it started with allergies and because her immune system was weaker she caught a big of some sort.

+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 5:35 PM",Yes,It could be a big bug

+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 5:53 PM",Yes,I suppose wearing gas masks is out of the question.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 5:57 PM",No,"Yeah, no gas masks haha. Not in this heat! \LF\LFCaeden has major asthma and allergy issues. He uses his inhaler as much as six times a day or more when it's really bad, in addition to taking an asthma prevention medication and allergy meds. The entire time we were in Washington this summer he didn't use his inhaler once. And he was being super active. Running around, hiking, playing with his cousin, etc. Normally he'd stay on the sidelines and not participate in physical activities at all. \LF\LFMakes me want to up and leave already. I would just need a good reason to leave though. Because as things stand in the divorce papers I'm stuck in Bexar county unless I have a judge change those orders. Or unless their Dad leaves first, which I don't see happening. I just know that Caeden will have many health issues if we stay here for the rest of his life. "
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:13 PM",Yes,My mother's health greatly improved once they got to Washington. It's amazing how just change of location can be so beneficial. I hope this new place they're headed to is going to be a nice area. Is Joe from San Antonio?

+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:19 PM",Yes,North Carolina... And I'm a terrible son for not knowing exactly where there.
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:19 PM",Yes,Some military area.
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:19 PM",Yes,He actually just retired.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 6:27 PM",No,Oh! Well congrats to him then! \LF\LFWhat made them pick North Carolina? Do you know? I assumed they would be in the Seattle area for quite a bit longer because of how you were talking about wanting to move up there. 
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:36 PM",Yes,"Yeah I know right?? I guess they don't care about me as much as I thought! Haha just kidding. My dad's dream job sorta popped out of nowhere. Quite the blessing. If he would have stayed in, from what I was told, finding a job after the army would have been pretty challenging considering his age. And North Carolina is where my dad is licensed for therapy."
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 6:40 PM",No,Well then even more congratulations are owed to him! That's an exciting change and one that seems to be a God-send. Those are always the best ones!

+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 6:43 PM",No,Does that change your own plans? 
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 6:56 PM",Yes,Oh I had know for a couple months I think. But I had to keep it a secret for a while. I'm so used to always having to keep it a secret everytime my dad gets orders so I just never mention it haha. My Dad of course is happy about it. He loves counseling people. And my mother will be glad to finally be back on the easy coast closer to family. Though leaving my brother in Oregon was hard for her.\LF\LFAnd no it doesn't change my plans. I figured they most likely wouldn't be living in Washington by the time I moved up north. I just didn't realize it would be so soon. Haha I would have liked to visit it some more without having to pay for a hotel. I still plan to stick around her for a while. Someday I will trek north. But for now I feel like this is where I am supposed to be.
+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 7:32 PM",No,"Well at least they didn't let you know at the last minute. That would have been very uncool. \LF\LFAnd it's good that you've seemed to be at piece with where you're at now and where you'd like to eventually be. That's not something everyone is able to do straight out of school. I know I want to be back up North, but I don't have a timeline, or any type of plan to work on getting me there. I figure that'll come with time. "
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 10:47 PM",Yes,"Sometimes I feel like God has just placed me in a river. I'll get caught against rocks and large pieces driftwood on occasion, but eventually the current will let me know when it's time to move on."
+17069923021,"Sep 27, 2014 10:48 PM",Yes,"I don't know where I'll be in 5 years, and that is ok."

+12103557887,"Sep 27, 2014 10:53 PM",No,"You don't feel stuck though, do you? I don't know that you were trying to give that impression, but I couldn't help but read along those lines with the visual you gave. \LF\LFAnd no, I didn't go to the church last week. I was falling behind on unpacking, so I skipped so I could try to finish. But we both know how well that went for me haha. I'll go next Sunday instead. I would've gone tomorrow if Kailani hadn't spent the last three days sick. "
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 10:08 AM",No,Good luck with the move today!
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:01 AM",Yes,Am I stuck? Technically I am due to finances and school. But even if I had the means to move right now I wouldn't. So I don't feel stuck.\LF\LFAnd thank you for your well wishes in our move.
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:01 AM",Yes,I was hoping we'd be able to start earlier. But my landlord said she wouldn't be in the office till 12.
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:03 AM",Yes,I should probably be finishing up the packing of my books haha.
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:06 AM",No,"Well then finish the books and make sure you eat a good solid lunch. Moving always makes me hungry haha\LF\LFAnd I have a better sense of what you meant by being caught but not stuck, per say. More like you're in a transition between one hill and another I guess? But at least you don't feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else right now. "
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:23 AM",Yes,"Ok I'll do that. I was gonna order pizza for the guys today but they ordered it last night while I was at work lol. Haha, I'll just order it anyway. And if they're sick of it, more pizza for me. lol\LF\LFI was trying to say that I've always felt somewhat guided in my life. And I just trust that when it's time I'll know."
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:25 AM",No,"Pizza sounds good. There's a really good pizza place near my new house that has amazing pizza and it's pretty inexpensive too. So, bonus! \LF\LFThat sounds like the best way to lead your life. Allow God to make the decisions for you since He knows what you need best anyway. "
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:27 AM",Yes,Ooh what's it called? I'm always hunting for pizza. lol
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:27 AM",No,Rami's Pizza
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:28 AM",No,There's another one on your side of town-ish. I think. 
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:29 AM",Yes,I'll have to look that one up. I've kinda been craving Big Lou's recently. And Kris has never been there! You've been to big Lou's right?
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:29 AM",No,No I've never been there. You told me about it though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:34 AM",Yes,It's pretty tasty. Aside from the occasional piece of tomato skin.
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:36 AM",No,Well at least you know it's fresh Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:37 AM",Yes,Haha yeah.
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 11:38 AM",Yes,We should go sometime! If you've never been!
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:38 AM",No,Sounds like a plan haha
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:40 AM",No,You know what I want to do? 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:40 AM",No,I want to have a dinner party. 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:40 AM",No,"Like a formal, multi-course meal, dinner party. "
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 11:40 AM",No,I've always wanted to do that. 
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 12:07 PM",Yes,=D
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 12:07 PM",Yes,That's sounds fun!
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 12:07 PM",Yes,And tasty!
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 12:07 PM",No,Maybe I could do one of those murder mystery dinner things. 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 12:07 PM",No,Make everyone dress up hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:11 PM",Yes,That sounds fun! Haha. I've never done one of those.
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 1:12 PM",No,I haven't either. I bet it could be cool though. 
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:14 PM",Yes,The only time I've ever seen people do them is in TVs and movies. And someone always ends up actually dying. Haha
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:14 PM",Yes,Hopefully that doesn't become a problem for us lol.
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:18 PM",Yes,Ha we just spent like an hour trying to fix the printer in the apartment office lol
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:18 PM",Yes,We ended up changing all the ink cartridges for her.
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 1:30 PM",Yes,Here's me carrying Kris across the threshold! ￼
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 1:48 PM",No,"Oh, I'd make sure to remove all weapons from the house before starting the dinner hahaha"
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 1:48 PM",No,I'm sure she appreciated the free tech work lol
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 1:48 PM",No,And look at you guys! Ready for a new life together Hahahaha 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 1:48 PM",No,He probably weighs the same as Kailani hahaha
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 2:19 PM",Yes,"Ha, I've got weapons! You'll just have to pat people down lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 2:19 PM",Yes,How's she feelin' today?
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 2:18 PM",No,I'll break out the metal detector haha
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 2:20 PM",No,She's feeling much much better. 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 2:20 PM",No,Eating Top Ramen like a boss. Haha
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 2:20 PM",No,"But we don't call it Ramen, we call it ""Ponyo soup"" because of the movie Ponyo"

+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 3:35 PM",Yes,That's good that she's feeling better. When did you get all those dogs?? Lol.
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 3:35 PM",No,Hahaha it's only two dogs 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 3:36 PM",No,And one cat 
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 3:39 PM",No,"I've had the cat, Charlie, for five and a half years. He was a rescue. I got him when he was eight weeks old. Lucy, the Shetland Sheepdog who looks like Lassie, I've had for four years, since she was five months old. Linus, the border collie/Greyhound mix, I rescued from the pound a year and a half ago when he was three years old. I'm more of a cat person really. I had to put down my other cat Ella, also a rescue, a little less than two years ago. She was 15. "
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 3:41 PM",No,There's a kitten at my mom's that will probably be joining us soon. But that's only if I feel like having even more of a zoo than I've already got haha
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 3:41 PM",No,I thought you knew I had dogs haha
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 5:04 PM",Yes,"I'm very familiar with Charlie. =) he's adorable. And now that you mention the names, I recall the dogs. I think I asked you if you had named Linus after Linus Torvalds. Lucy is gorgeous."
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 5:09 PM",No,"He's not really all that adorable. He's way too fat and lazy to be adorable hahaha\LF\LFYeah, they're my Peanuts children. Charlie, Lucy, and Linus. Kailani wants a hedgehog, who would be named Pigpen, and Caeden wants a bearded dragon, who would be named Woodstock. The kitten I was telling you we might get is named Spike (after Snoopy's brother). My sister gets annoyed with the theme. But I think it's funny. \LF\LFLucy is gorgeous, yes. She's a purebred. But she's the sweetest most well tempered dog I've ever met. And she's super soft and cuddly. Linus is a bit annoying, unfortunately. He's jealous and doesn't like for Lucy to get attention. So they're very much siblings I guess haha\LF\LFHow's the move going? "
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,"Fat lazy kitties are adorable lol. Kitties are just snuggly and adorable in general. At least that's usually the case for me.\LF\LFWait sooo they're all named after Peanuts characters? Don't hate me, but... I am very unfamiliar with the Peanuts. Haha I didn't have the luxury of experiencing these wonderful American shows. Lol you are building a zoo aren't you. And I am in full support of adopting the kitten.\LF\LFAnd the move has been pretty successful. We have almost everything from my old apartment in the new apartment. Just have the fish, cleaning supplies, network stuff, and washer dryer. It has been quite the day. I am so glad I asked for 3 days.\LF\LFWhat's funny is we didn't actually sign a lease. She couldn't get the printer working, so she asked us for help. We fixed one name in the printer. But there was another one. We worked on it for about 30 minutes, which is what lead to her asking if we'd change the ink cartridges haha. She ended up just giving us the keys. Hopefully we'll be able to sign it tomorrow lol."
+17069923021,"Sep 28, 2014 8:54 PM",Yes,Our oven looks like someone really large sat on it.
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 9:08 PM",No,"Once you meet him you'll understand what I mean about him not being all that adorable hahaha\LF\LFYeah, all Charlie Brown and the Peanuts characters. It didn't start that way on purpose. I had Charlie first and when I got Lucy, she just looked like a Lucy. It didn't turn into a thing until I got Linus and I was trying to figure out a name. People had already made comments about the Peanuts theme, so I just kept it going haha. I have most of the Peanuts tv specials. We can watch the Halloween one for the party if you'd like. It's a definite American classic. \LF\LFI've always loved animals, but I think adding any more to the current living situation would be a bit too much haha. The kitten became good friends with Charlie though. So we might have to add one more to the bunch for now.  But we shall see...\LF\LFAre you trying to finish moving everything today? Or will you finish tomorrow instead? And are you just moving boxes, etc? Or are you starting to unpack already as well? The overlap should help a great deal either way. You still have to clean the old apartment right? I always hated that part. \LF\LFAt least she still have you the keys. Most places wouldn't have let you take keys without signing papers. I'm sure she'll be calling you in to the office tomorrow to take care of that. And make sure you tell her about the oven when you're signing papers. See if there's anything that can be done about that. That's very odd. "
+12103557887,"Sep 28, 2014 9:18 PM",No,*gave you the keys
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 12:15 PM",Yes,"I wanted to text you more last night haha, but Sarah was holding onto my phone, and I felt odd bugging her about it every 5 minutes. I was wearing gym shorts last night during the move because it was warm. Muggy heavy lifting whilst wearing jeans is not my idea of a party. So as I was lacking pockets, I gave my keys and phone and wallet to her to put in her purse.\LF\LFWe got most everything done last night. We left my bathroom stuff, and the tubs on my back porch. Which I was able to pick all of that up this morning. And Kris left his clothes and a few boxes at his apartment. We were able to get his bed and his dining table, which, I was surprised to see is quite decent. So right now only the fish and cleaning supplies are in my apartment. Matt said he would help me move the tank later tonight when he got home. But I might try it by myself if I get free time earlier. I might just have to end up taking the sand out of the tank. It most likely needs a good rinsing anyway; just a tad nasty in there.\LF\LFWe finished our last unload of the night around 12, then Kris and I stayed up till 4 unpacking. I finished the kitchen,  living room, and my closet last night. I'm working on my room currently. The big thing right now is figuring out where I can put my bookcase.\LF\LFI am so exhausted, my wrists hurt, my fingers hurt, and my stomach hurts from the junk we ate yesterday. Matts poor knees are killing him, and Kris walked out of his room hunched over like an old man. Hehe it was quite a spectacle. Oh and my landlord called both of us at 8 this morning to tell us that she still couldn't print out the lease. So I'm going to try my hardest to go to bed early and catch up on the sleep I've been missing the past few weeks.\LF\LFThe great pumpkin? I've seen tiny bits of it. They would sometimes use clips of it for AFN commercials in italy. Haha probably used illegally, but our TV station was kinda ghetto like that; just a bunch of kids sitting in a studio with a bunch of equipment. lol.\LF\LFSpeaking of Halloween, I don't know what to wear. What would be easy to put together, but at the same time not pathetic haha. Have you though at all about what your going to wear?\LF\LFHow is your day going? What are you doing at work right now? Jimmy Fallon sesh? =P"
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 12:19 PM",Yes,￼
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 12:50 PM",No,"I knew you were busy, so I wasn't expecting a day full of conversation at all haha. And I certainly didn't want to get in the way of you having a successful move. \LF\LFWhen I moved it was over 100 degrees outside and I almost passed out twice from heat exhaustion. So I can completely understand how horrible that process was for you yesterday. The mugginess always seems to make things worse. \LF\LFIt sounds like you made very good progress though, so that's exciting! Hopefully you'll be able to finish with the unpacking soon too. There's nothing worse than living out of boxes for extended periods of time. It seems like you were better prepared for this move than I was for mine. Although, I am proud to say that after this weekend I'm totally unpacked as well! \LF\LFSleep will be the best thing to help your body and brain recover from all of the physical and mental stress of your move. I personally love a good bath, but I know that's not a typical adult thing to do. There's nothing like a good soak with some bath salts to help get rid of the aches and pains though. Or I would say to go get a massage, but I don't know your stance on that either haha\LF\LFThe Great Pumpkin is a great one! I'm trying to think if I have any other Halloween themed movies other than the Nightmare Before Christmas, which could be either Halloween or Christmas depending on what you focus on in that story, and I think those are the only two I have. \LF\LFNo, honestly I haven't thought about costumes. Do you know when you're planning on doing the party? I was thinking it could be fun to do the murder mystery dinner party that weekend. Maybe on Sunday? And it would be a costume party as well, although you'd be required to dress up as your character from the story. I'm debating that one though. I've still got time to plan. \LF\LFMy day is going alright. I had a lot of catching up to do after missing work on Friday for Kailani. But that's all taken care of now and I'm moving on to the other normal routines, such as the Jimmy Fallon videos (for shame, for shame) and such. Ironically, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick were on his show last week, and I thought of you when I watched their clip. It's kind of funny, but lately just about every time I've thought of you is when you'll send me a text. Almost like your ears are burning or something haha"

The one big thing I haven't done is gotten the washer dryer moved. We still haven't gotten a dolly for it. And I was so convinced that I would be able to manage it with the guys that I didn't call appliance Warehouse to ask them to move it. I'm not really happy about my stubbornness there. I'm gonna call them after class to see if they would be able to to a move at such short notice, if not I'm just going to have to find a dolly.\LF\LFon the brighter side of things I transferred all my network equipment and got internet working today, which is awesome because one of my classes requires internet for all the homework we do.\LF\LFYou're totally unpacked?? Yay! I bet that's a nice feeling. What did you do with all your boxes?\LF\LFI'm conflicted when it comes to bathes. Soaking in hot water is quite relaxing, but I find sitting in tubs, specifically tubs that double as showers, kinda gross. And I haven't had regular access to a non shower tub since I was very small. But yes they are quite fantastic. I have a habit of using very hot water when I bathe.\LF\LFI am not experienced with professional masseuses at all. And honestly I don't even know how I would react in that situation. I do know that my mind tends to associate most physical contact with some level of intimacy with others, so I can't say for certain whether or not I would be comfortable with a stranger massaging me.

So, needless to say, that was a long, hot, irritating, and stressful day. \LF\LFMy family has a dolly if you need to borrow it. No one is using it for anything right now. It wouldn't be a problem. \LF\LFI still haven't hooked up the internet over here haha.

For whatever reason, my complex recycles! Which I'm happy about, of course. \LF\LFThe tubs here aren't all that great. I grew up with huge claw foot tubs, and miss those very much. It's sad to say that I've not had a handful of really satisfying baths since I've moved from the Northwest. My water gets really hot too. The kids always get mad when I draw the water for their baths because they say I'm trying to boil them! Haha\LF\LFI love massages! But maybe that's because I actually used to be a massage therapist. I went to school for that when I was 17 and maintained my license for almost 7 years and I worked in a spa for some time too. But it was too hard to work in that industry when I was pregnant and I ended up just not going back to the spa. I still have my massage table though. And my family members will often ask for a freebie. Especially my sister, but she'll always trade off in some way. Watch the kids for me or something like that, so at least I don't feel like she's taking advantage. My kids love getting massages too, of course. But all that means is that I end up giving them more than I receive them. Sigh\LF\LFWill you be asking off of work for Halloween then? The dinner would basically be planned ahead of time. I would send out invitations and character information to the people who were being invited. Then on the night of the dinner there's a script that is followed during the dinner. Everyone comes dressed up and plays the role of the character they've been given. I've never done one before either, but I've always wanted to and it seems fun. \LF\LFYou've never heard of burning ears? Haha that's a really old one. And yes, there's always the possibility that the telepathic sensors are slightly more in tune haha. It's interesting how stuff like that works. But I'm glad to know it's not just me that's experiencing it."

Yesterday you sent a text that I didn't receive until two hours later. So if I don't reply right away, it's probably because my phone is being wonky.

+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:09 PM",No,It was nice to see you too. And you don't owe me anything. I never expect anything in return for what I do for others. I enjoyed being able to help you. Simple as that. 
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:11 PM",No,"Plus, I got to show that I'm not some weakling little girl haha. That was enough for me! "
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:26 PM",Yes,"Well then I don't owe you, but maybe we can have lunch again sometime anyway lol. And well I knew you weren't a weakling. I've seen you in action. Although those things tonight were pretty darn heavy."
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:26 PM",No,"Hahaha I just don't play the ""keeping score"" game is all. But if you'd like to have lunch just because, then I'm perfectly okay with that too! And when have you seen me in action before? I didn't think you'd ever seen me lift anything. "
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:36 PM",Yes,"Yeah saying ""owe"" is a bit of a habit of mine. I don't really mean it in the sense that I feel indebted to someone. It's more of like a ""I call dibs on doing something nice next."" I'm not quite sure I picked it up. I'm the only one in my family that says it.\LF\LFAnd I saw you push around some mean looking pallets. Remember that one with the boxes that were stacked super high? And I bet that you wouldn't be able to wheel it out to toys without dropping one? You totally showed me up. I guess that doesn't really fall under the category of heavy lifting though. But I was still impressed."
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:39 PM",No,"Haha okay I understand now. And that's fine. You can say owe in that case. \LF\LFThat's true. I guess I did lug some big pallets around. But it wasn't quite the same as pulling an 80+ pound dryer up a flight of stairs haha. I didn't have a pallet jack to help me tonight. I may look small, but I've got a fair amount of power in me lol "
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:39 PM",Yes,It's more playful than serious.
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:41 PM",No,"Gotcha. As long as you don't truly feel indebted to me, that's all that matters. "
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:42 PM",Yes,You're just like beast! ￼
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:43 PM",No,Haha no no. But I'm impressed you remembered he's my favorite. 
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:45 PM",Yes,There are a few things that I don't forget easily.
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:46 PM",Yes,I'm selective elephant haha.
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:46 PM",No,Hahaha that's a new one! Does a selective elephant have a specific marking of some type to denote his specific mental capabilities? 
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:48 PM",No,And does a selective elephant have the capacity to choose what is remembered? Or is it a random occurrence? 
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:49 PM",Yes,"Selective elephants occasionally morph back and forth between elephant and their other form. And as for choice, it's little of both."
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:50 PM",No,So it can be both a blessing and a curse huh? 
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:50 PM",Yes,But something's come very easy; depending on what stimuli is available to associate with it.
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:51 PM",Yes,"Yeah, it can."
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,But a selective elephant is also fairly good at keeping unwanted memories in the background.
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:52 PM",No,That is good then. 
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:54 PM",No,I'm just a normal elephant who doesn't forget. I don't get to pick what I remember either. That makes it hard. 
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:56 PM",No,Okay. I'm texting with one eye open hahaha. I'd better go to bed. Don't stay up too late! And good luck getting everything finished. See you later! Good night Andrew!
+17069923021,"Sep 29, 2014 10:58 PM",Yes,"Goodnight Jessie, lol get some sleep. =)"
+12103557887,"Sep 29, 2014 10:58 PM",No,"Goodnight Andrew, I will Haha"
+17069923021,"Sep 30, 2014 3:47 PM",Yes,"We recycle here too, the problem is we have a really tiny recycling dumpster that rarely gets emptied. My first month here I separated all my recyclables, but was never actually able to fit them in. So eventually I gave up. The status hasn't seemed to change since then either, it's a bit sad.\LF\LFNow that I think about it, I think you might have mentioned your therapy days to me. I just never really realized you did it for so long. What kinds of things do you learn at massage therapy school?\LF\LFYou've done quite a bit. You said you've done gymnastics and martial arts right? Did you ever learn formal dance? I would like to take a class on that eventually. It would be super awkward for me, but I'd enjoy it in the end I'm sure.\LF\LFI am going to be requesting Halloween off. We're not really planning anything super extravagant. Kris and Sarah want to hand candy out to kids that come by. I just want to spend time with people; playing games or watching movies. We could watch some super scary stuff, but I know you don't like jump scares. Kris and Matt don't like scary movies either, haha. I don't understand! lol. Both their girlfriends do though. And they want to go see that new movie Annabelle, but Kris and Matt don't. So I'll probably have to end up kidnapping Sarah and Jessica to go see it haha.\LF\LFAnd I know I've already thanked you for your help last night, but I can't even express how grateful I am. You really saved my butt and relieved a huge anxiety from my shoulders. So, thank you... again. Also my hip is bruised haha."
+17069923021,"Sep 30, 2014 3:48 PM",Yes,Now I'm cleaning the rest of the apartment. Really not looking forward to this oven. Then I'll have to say goodbye to this place. We had a good run. Quite a few find memories were made here.
+12103557887,"Sep 30, 2014 5:24 PM",No,"Sorry, I was picking up the kids and then driving...\LF\LFYou learn anatomy and physiology. All the bones, muscles, nerves, the lymphatic system, etc. and then different techniques of massage. You have to pass a state board exam to be a registered therapist. It's an all-day written and practical exam. The written test was over 300 questions about anatomy and physiology, laws, business, massage history, techniques, etc. and it's timed and not an easy test to pass. Some people from my school had to take it more than once and it costs money to take each time. The practical portion of the test was you being video taped demonstrating certain massage techniques on specific assigned (random) areas of the body. And then you also had to show massage terminology on the person in front of you as well. It was a super stressful day and I wouldn't go through that again unless I absolutely had to! But I still remember all the techniques, and from what I've been told, I can give a pretty awesome  massage. But maybe that's just friends and family buttering me up for a freebie haha\LF\LFI don't know that I've done quite a bit. Haha. Maybe I have...I didn't do gymnastics, no. But I did study Jiu Jitsu for six months in high school. It was okay. I'm just not that aggressive, so it felt kind of weird. And I stopped going gyre my female grappling partner quit. I wasn't comfortable grappling with fellow teenage boys. \LF\LFI actually did ballroom dance for five years haha. It's been a while, but I can still bust out a move if I want. I often waltz with my kids (or my cat lol) around the house. I even had a swing dancing partner in middle school and we would have started competing if my family hadn't moved. I love ballroom dance so much! It looks a lot harder than it actually is. I used to dance with my grandfathers all the time hahaha. So much fun! I'd love to pick it back up again. There are a lot of places in San Antonio that offer free classes with group dancing and live music afterwards. I've just never found anyone who wants to go with me. Sigh. \LF\LFYeah, I'm not a huge fan of jump scares. But we could watch the Burbs, or the Rocky Horror Picture Show, those are both somewhat Halloweeny. We could certainly play games and have fun. And I think I know what I'm going to dress up as. I had some time to mull over ideas at work today.  \LFYou're more than welcome for the help. I'm glad I was able to relieve some stress. My guess is the bruise probably came from leaping over the washer. I saw you caught your side, but you played it off well haha. I've never been able to move houses without getting at least one bruise. It's all part of the struggle I guess. \LF\LFAnd good for you being on the home stretch of the move too! Cleaning is absolutely the worst! I apologize if any of the oven mess has to do with me lol. You're definitely at the beginning of a new era though. In which many more fond memories will be made, I'm sure. "
+17069923021,"Sep 30, 2014 10:41 PM",Yes,"Well they prolly wouldn't butter you up unless you were good at it lol. So you must be.\LF\LFWeird, I thought you said you had done gymnastics. You only did six months of Jiu Jitsu? In what way was it aggressive? I took karate for a couple years when I was younger, then after we moved I did taekwondo for a number of years. So those are the only ones I have experience with. Those were really fun. I never really liked sparring though, simply because I don't like hitting people. So when I would spar with people I would just continuously dodge and dart around haha. Actually when I was being examined for my black belt, I was required to spar a friend of mine from class. It was timed, and basically consisted of my avoiding all of his advances. I think I hit him like twice during the whole thing. Haha, now that I'm actually thinking about what I did, I wonder what the judges were thinking lol. ""What the heck is this guy doing?? Why isn't he attacking??""\LF\LFI'd totally go to a dance class with you. My parents went to one for a bit while we were living in GA, and occasionally they would ask me for help with certain steps. I wasn't familiar with them, but I could usually figure out what they were trying to do after they demoed a few attempts. That was always really fun. They said at their dance class sometimes they didn't even get to dance together though because they were made to switch partners every few minutes. That kinda made me feel uncomfortable about pursuing it too. \LF\LFI've never seen Rocky Picture Horror Show, is The Burbs Halloweeny? Oh you know what, I'm thinking of a different movie. The one where they buy a house and everything seems to go wrong with it. The reason I'm getting them mixed up is because I bought both those in a two pack. Nightmare before Christmas is also good. \LF\LFAm I allowed to know what your planning on dressing up as? I still haven't figured out what I'm going to do. There's a costume that I would love to be able to do. But it would require a lot of preparation and money, so getting it together before Halloween isn't likely. It's a character from a Legend of Zelda game named Kaffei. It's a long side story in the game that most people don't play through due to it's length and complexity. I love the story of though, I'll give you a little summary. You can skip it if you want. \LF\LFIt follows the story of this guy, Kaffei. He had fallen in love with this girl named Anju who runs an inn in the town they live in. They decided to get engaged.(Masks are a very core part of this game. Almost everyone has a mask that is symbolic of they're character.) They make a promise that on the dawn of they're wedding day they would fuse they're masks together into one as symbol of their love for each other.(Kinda like a ""two shall become of one flesh"" type thing.) Anyway, days before their wedding day someone cursed him to look like a child(Kinda looks like he's 10-12 now.). Seeking help, he attempts to meet with someone who he thinks can change him back. Instead he is ambushed by a thief named Sakon who steals his mask. With his mask being stolen, he can no fulfill his vow to fuse his mask with Anju's. Ashamed, he goes into hiding. He finds out that the thief who stole his mask frequents a nearby shop that offers curiously magical goods. Kaffei decides he will spy on the shop. His goal is to follow Sakon back to his hideout and aquire his mask back so that he can fulfill his promise to Anju. This is where we come in. On a visit to the inn, Anju's mother mistakes you for a private investigator. Anju is an absolute wreck because Kaffei has been missing for days. Anju's mom hires you to figure out what has happened. After quite a bit of hunting and other various adventures, you finally catch up with Kaffei. He tells you the whole story of the vow and the theft and you agree to help him. He asks you to deliver a pendant to her that contains memories of their times together. With it there is also a letter, a new promise to Anju, if she will wait for him in her room at the inn on the eve of the Carnival of Time he will reunite with her and fulfill the covenant they made.(A little back story, the main antagonist in the game is making the moon fall slowly towards the earth. For the three days leading up to the Carnival of Time, it continues to fall. Many of the townsfolk have been evacuating still others don't think it's actually going to collide with the town so they stay.) So after delivering the letter and pendant, you and Kaffei spend the next 3 days trying to find Sakon's hideout. On the night of the final day you find the hideout and break in. But a trap has been placed. As soon as you get inside the mask starts moving on a sealed conveyor belt that leads to it's destruction. You and Kaffei have to work together to solve puzzle rooms to get to the end of the conveyor belt before the mask does. If you succeed in getting the mask, you and Kaffei race back to town to reunite with Anju. It is now approaching the dawn of the final day. The moon is falling very fast now. You and Kaffei get to the room where Anju has been waiting all night. Anju sees Kaffei and recognizes him even though he looks like a child. They embrace, and with you as their witness, they exchange their vows and fuse their mask into one. Then they hold one another, awaiting the imminent coming of dawn and the destruction of their town.\LF\LFIt's arguably the longest side story out of the entire Zelda franchise. There are a lot of things you have to do, and you're timed as well. There are several different ways to fail, and each way has it's own unique ending to the story. I just absolutely adore it.\LF\LFAnyway, the guy, Kaffei, has a mask that he wears when he goes into hiding. It's a mask that resembles the face of a mythological creature know as a Keaton. A Keaton is a wise yellow fox with many tails. I really want to dress up in Kaffei's attire and don a Keaton mask. Wow that ended up being a lot longer than I had anticipated."
+17069923021,"Sep 30, 2014 10:43 PM",Yes,"So of course I love the story, but the fact that he hides behind the face of a fox makes me love it that much more."
+12103557887,"Sep 30, 2014 11:20 PM",No,"No, no gymnastics. I'm very nervous about stuff that could potentially break my neck and paralyze me haha. I went to elementary school with a kid who did a flip into the ball pit at the McDonalds in our town when he was 7 and he hit his head on the tube you jump into the pit from. He cracked his neck and was paralyzed from 7 years old on. That always freaked me out. I've never even attempted to do a flip before. Not once in my entire life. So, no gymnastics for me haha\LF\LFJiu Jitsu is a very powerhouse, tackle, break your bones, rip out your eyes, tear through your skin kind of martial art. It's the one most commonly used in mixed martial arts competitions like UFC, etc. It can be a very dangerous sport. One of my friends had a shoulder dislocate while doing a grapple into a monkey roll in class. And there was no resistance from his partner either. So even the moves on their own, without engaging with another person, can be pretty extreme. \LF\LFI think some ballroom classes encourage you to switch partners, but I've never heard of any class requiring you to switch partners if you're already going with someone. If you really want to try one out, we can do some looking around and find one. Just let me know! \LF\LFYou may or may not like Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's incredibly racy haha. It's essentially about an alien transvestite who is trying to create his ideal man, but it's a musical. Cyndi Lauper, Meatloaf, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Curry all star in it. It's pretty hilarious, but again, rather racy. You may want to YouTube some clips just to get a general idea of the story. I think explaining it would be super confusing. \LF\LFI think you were thinking of the Money Pit. Right? I'd say The Burbs is pretty Halloweeny. I mean, it's a silly murder mystery, right? You've seen it before, haven't you? I thought I saw it in your movie list on whatever device it is you use to store your movies. I haven't seen it in a couple years, but it's one of the few times I've found Tom Hanks to be genuinely funny. \LF\LFI was thinking of dressing up as Roxanne from A Goofy Movie. It's not super detailed, but that's one of my favorite cartoons. Plus, it would be an easy costume haha and although I'd love to go all out and do some awesome cosplay, I don't think I've got the time for that this year. \LF\LFSo, don't be completely disappointed, but I'm not a gamer at all. I don't know anything about the Legend of Zelda... My mom didn't allow video games in the house when I was growing up, and by the time I was a teenager and all my friends were playing games, I was never able to develop the hand-eye coordination needed to play video games successfully. I will sit and watch someone else play games, and have done that many many times before, but I don't play them myself. My boyfriend in high school played video games with his friends, but they were all the Madden games and Joe gamed throughout our relationship, but I never saw him play anything in the Zelda series. He was into Morrowind for a while (is that the right title?), but he played a lot of shooter games mostly...Halo, Call of Duty, etc. Zelda sounds like a very involved game though. Do you prefer the RPG games? I feel like if I ever played a game it would need to have a good story. I just can't seem to figure out how to use the controllers haha\LF\LFThe story you shared was very beautiful though. And I can see how you'd be drawn to that character and especially that mask. There's another Hayao Miyazaki movie (the same director who did Nausicaa) I have that I want you to watch sometime. It's called Pom Poko and it's about raccoons and their magical properties. It's almost done in the style of a documentary, but it's still an anime, so it's got a very different feel to it. There are also some foxes in it though, so you'd probably enjoy it for that too haha \LF\LFI feel like our texts are covering so many topics at once now that we're almost writing books each time Hahahaha. It takes me 30 minutes just to write a response! It's almost like we're writing letters lol. Not that I mind, I'm just making an observation. Because that's me and I notice odd things like that...\LF\LFAnyway, I'm gonna head to bed now. I hope you were able to finish with all the moving and cleaning successfully and that the stress of the weekend is over with. Have a good night, Andrew. And sleep well, you deserve some good, solid rest! Goodnight! \LF"

I feel very comfortable doing front flips, given there's something soft to land on in case my butt hits the ground instead of my feet. Backflips are another story. I used to do them a lot when I had a trampoline, but I stopped because i started gaining more and more when I did them, until occasionally I would land on the springs. But your fear of getting paralyzed is life preserving so that's good. I typically avoid/am extremely careful in situations where losing my hands or fingers is possible. My hands are very important to me. So things like putting your arm out a car window, using a band saw, hands up on a roller coaster, or operating certain hydraulic equipment can sometimes make me very uncomfortable.\LF\LFAnd yes I would really like to take a ballroom class. I would just have to be able to work it out with school, homework, work, and of course your schedule. *Sigh* Exams paired with moving has made these last two weeks a real stresser. I need some free time! lol\LF\LFAnd I don't mind racy movies so much, it can just be awkward watching those types of movies with certain people you know? I know a few of my friends get really uncomfortable during sex scenes or nudity and as a result it makes me uncomfortable because I know they are. Haha when we watched Ishtar I had forgotten about the scene where the girl leading the Rebellion flashes Clark. So I kinda had a freak out moment leading up to it because I didn't know how you would react. And yes, Money Pit is what I'm thinking of. I would have to see a screenshot from the burbs to jog my memory. I do own it, and I have seen It. I just can't seem to remember what it's about.\LF\LFHaha, I'm not disappointed. I remember you telling me briefly about your lack of gaming experience. As for Zelda, they typically aren't as involved as the one that I told you about. Usually they follow a main story with a few side stories here and there. The one I described, Majora's Mask, has a fairly short story, and then there are several side quests that you have the option to do. It's a very unique game in the way that you play it in ""real time"" so to speak. Imagine the movie Groundhog Day, only instead of living one day over and over, you repeat the same 3 days over and over. I really don't think I could do it justice by explaining it through a text.\LF\LFAnd in terms of game genre's, RPGs are among my favourites. Of course, it has to have a decent story haha. I usually enjoy the Final Fantasy series. I've played most of them. They have a lot of cutscenes, lore, and side adventures that break off from the main story. And many of them have very simple gameplay so that you can focus on the story without getting flustered by having to react quickly in situations or mastering buttons. If I were to recommend a game for you start off with, it would most likely be a Final Fantasy game. \LF\LFDid you know there's a game that Studio Ghibli did all the animation for? ""Ni No Kuni"" it came out last year i believe. I have it but never got around to playing much of it due to time constraints at the time of acquisition. It's quite beautiful. And it has all the unique quirks of a Miyazaki movie. It's gameplay is fairly simple so I'm sure you'd be able to adapt quite well to it. I'd love to switch off playing it with you if you were interested. But don't feel pressured if your not.\LF\LFWe should have a Miyazaki marathon then. I've been waiting on Totoro cause I kinda wanted to watch it with you.\LF\LFAnd yes these texts are getting long lol. That's why I don't always answer right away, because I want to have enough time to deliver an appropriate response. They're like instant lettering!... Or I guess email... Minus the email part. And I noticed my phone won't even put the entire text in the message feed, I have to tap it to view your texts. I'm not complaining, I enjoy it. Hopefully I'm not bothering you by taking up 30 minutes of your day though haha.\LF\LFHope work is going well for you. I have to go take an exam in an hour. Have a wonderful rest of your day Jessie!"
+12103557887,"Oct 1, 2014 3:34 PM",No,"I can swim very well, but I was also afraid of cracking my head on the bottom of the pool and drowning haha. I guess I'm a nervous person about stuff like that. I love to swim and I'll jump on a trampoline, but no flips, no. \LF\LFFortunately my schedule is now pretty set. I'm sure we can look for a time to take a class together when you feel like your schedule is more open. The last thing I would want for you to do would be to set time aside for me when you really should be focusing on something else. We'll find a time that works, eventually. \LF\LFRacy stuff doesn't bother me at all. Well, I take that back...I would never watch porn, that's too much for me. But I don't think that's the same as raciness in regular movies. I can get embarrassed if I know the people I'm watching the movie with are uncomfortable with something though. So if I know the other person doesn't like something or is uncomfortable, that's  pretty much the only time I'll get embarrassed or self conscious. Watching movies with my mom is ridiculously difficult. She won't let anything (a bad word, nudity, drugs, sex, anything!) get by without making some awkward comment. There are times when I feel like telling her, ""look, I'm an adult, I've pretty much seen it all at this point, and quite frankly, I'm certain that you have too, so either watch the movie and let that stuff go, or just leave the room if you don't like it"", but I feel like saying something like that might come off as disrespectful. \LF\LFThe Burbs is about Tom Hanks thinking his neighbors are serial killers. And all the crazy stuff he does trying to catch them in the act. I was thinking we could watch Young Frankenstein too, that's another Halloweeny one. \LF\LFI actually own Ni No Kuni, but for the PS3, and I'm getting that system for the kids for Christmas, so they haven't played it yet haha  but as soon as I saw the animation I snatched it up! I may be open to trying a game, you'd just have to be patient with me learning how to work the controls. I'm not even that great at Mario Kart lol\LF\LFA Miyazaki marathon would be soooo fantastic! There are so many you haven't seen that are so good! And I think I have all of his. Except for one which still needs to be released in the US. It would take several days to get through all of his stuff though. But the stories and artwork are just so beautiful. There's another one his studio released but he did not direct called the Grave of the Fireflies, it's about the atomic bombs being dropped on Japan. It's a very beautiful movie but I cried for days after watching it, it affected me that much. Very haunting. \LF\LFI have to tap over to view your texts as well. And again, I wasn't complaining about the length, just making an observation. The only reason why it takes me so long to respond is because I read through the response more than once, finish some editing, etc. it's the English major in me I guess haha\LF\LFYou're probably taking your test right now, so I hope the phone buzzing doesn't distract you when I hit send. But good luck with the test! Try not to be stressed with all of the moving and school stuff you've got going on. If you need a day to relax this weekend, I'll be free to hang out. Have a great day too Andrew!  "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 5:42 PM",Yes,"My mom would do the same thing. She would pause movies and say, ""Now you know this isn't how we do things right?"" She stopped doing that once I got into my late teen years. I guess she saw the set of values and moral guidelines I hold myself too... well try to at least. Now she only makes comments if there's boobs or an obscene amount of F-bombs being dropped. ""Andrew close your eyes!"" I agree with her on the language thing though. I mean, regardless of how I feel about myself using them, they do hold a certain impactful power in movies. But sometimes it's just over used and it detracts from the script. But again, that's my opinion, others may feel different of course. \LF\LFIf you really want to play, I would be super patient. I'm a pretty good teacher too. You don't have any motion sickness issues do you? And Mario Kart is a pretty tough game! I wouldn't reccomend it as a starting point for getting familiar with controls lol. I've got a ton of games for several systems, I'm sure we wouldn't have any trouble finding one suited for you. =)\LF\LFWhat's the name of the one that hasn't been real eased stateside?\LF\LFI got the text a few minutes before the exam started so I got a chance to read through it. I think I did well. It was a lot easier than I was expecting, fun too!\LF\LFDo you have a preference for Saturday or Sunday for doing something?"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 5:58 PM",No,"Language is extremely powerful, yes. I think that's why linguistics drew me in so much. Because the older I got, the more I realized how much one word can make a person feel. How a word is created and what decides it's meaning was always really interesting to me. And also, how words and their meanings change over time truly excites me. I think that comes from my love of reading. \LF\LFI'd be willing to give a game a try haha but like I said, be patient!\LF\LF""The Wind Rises"" had a limited theatrical release early this year, but it's not on DVD yet. It's a slightly biographical movie about Miyazaki himself. I didn't get to see it in the theatre, so I've been waiting for the DVD. \LF\LFExams always threw me off. If I thought they were easy, I usually looked back on it in hindsight and realized that I probably made mistakes along the way. I don't test well though. I psych myself out pretty easily. I always have. Nerves tend to throw me off. Unless I really just don't care about it, and then I end up doing just fine. Ironic how stuff like that works. \LF\LFI'm free all weekend. Just have some cleaning to do tonight and tomorrow. I need to try and run a few times to prep for my 5k, but I can do that whenever. I was also planning on going to church Sunday morning. But that's about it. No other plans yet. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 7:43 PM",Yes,"I have a shift on Saturday from 12-430 that I've been trying to pass off. Jimmy made it sound like it wouldn't be an issue to find someone to take it. Other than that either day is fine for me, or both haha. But I don't want to overload you lol.\LF\LFWhen is the 5k? I've been wanting to go hiking these past few weeks. Maybe I'll be able to this weekend.\LF\LFAnd I've got some ps3 games you can have/borrow for the kids come Christmas time. When you come over you can look through them."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 9:05 PM",No,"Not to overload you either, but both days is fine with me haha. If you can get your shift covered, maybe we can go hiking on Saturday. Have you been to Enchanted Rock before? That's a fun hike. We could hike one day and do a movie/game day on the other if you want. Just let me know. \LF\LFThe 5k is November 1st. It's a Zombie Run haha. My friend Emily and I are doing it. We're going to be humans, but we're going to dress up as some kind of zombie hunters haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 9:20 PM",No,"￼And this is Spike. Who may or may not be coming home with us. He's named after one of Snoopy's brothers. So, another Peanuts-gang member. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 9:46 PM",Yes,"Hiking Saturday and movie-games on Sunday sounds perfect actually. I'll get in touch with Jimmy again tomorrow to see whats up.\LF\LFI haven't been to enchanted rock! My friend Andrew kept saying that we should go some time but we never went. How rough is the hike?\LF\LFZombie hunters, ooh that sounds fun. Need any weapons? lol. My sai might be a little heavy for a 5k run, but I do have an airsoft gun. Unless they frown upon weapon props... although this is Texas haha.\LF\LFAnd Spike is so precious! Kitties make me melt inside in case you haven't noticed by now haha.\LF\LFWere you going to go to the church your mom suggested? Or another one?"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 9:59 PM",No,"Sounds like it could be an exciting weekend then! Just let me know what you're able to work out and when we should plan on meeting up, etc. \LF\LFThe hike isn't really all that rough. It's up a very large rock, so good shoes are essential, but that's about it. The view is pretty spectacular though. I've heard it's best to be on top of the rock around evening/sunset time, but I've only been once during the afternoon before. There's some small caves and many many trails in the area which can be explored, so it could be either a short trip just up the rock, or a longer hike exploring the area and ending on top of the rock.  \LF\LFWe're probably going to use plastic weapons haha \LFI don't know what all yours look like. I don't know if we'll run with the weapons though. We might just take photos looking like hardcore killers beforehand hahaha\LF\LFSpike may look precious but he's quite the mischievous little bugger haha\LF\LFI haven't decided where I'm going to church yet. I was going to do some research tomorrow at work and try to figure out what I wanted to do. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:01 PM",Yes,￼
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:01 PM",Yes,"Raphael's weapons, you could totally do some zombie stabbing with those!"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:02 PM",No,I guess I could go as April...
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:02 PM",Yes,lol
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:02 PM",No,But I'm pretty sure she never fought zombies haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,Well if you want 'em for photos they're yours. You could even splatter some blood on the tapers.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,And being mischievous makes them that much more adorable.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,Cats that is.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:04 PM",No,"Oh, the blood spatters will be on more than just the weapons haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:04 PM",No,"Haha, yes I knew you meant the cats "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,"Well you never know, I could have been talking about giraffes."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:06 PM",No,"Haha I suppose. But other than cats, the next closest thing you had just mentioned were weapons. Which I'm pretty sure can't be mischievous on their own. "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:06 PM",No,So I went with cats. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,What about in Quest for Camelot! Those weapons were pretty mischievous.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Though I guess they were part people too.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,And not so adorable.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",Yes,Except for the chicken axe.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",No,Hahaha definitely not adorable. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:08 PM",No,And the chicken axe was a mistake. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:09 PM",No,"And there was magic involved there. So they still weren't really ""on their own"" in the full sense either. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:10 PM",Yes,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:09 PM",No,Disappointed? Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:10 PM",Yes,"Haha, no the debate was fun."
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:11 PM",Yes,Though short.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:11 PM",No,Haha sorry for that 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:12 PM",No,I wasn't trying to shut it down that fast or anything lol 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:13 PM",Yes,I know lol. I just too often run in defending a point I know won't win haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:13 PM",No,Well at least you give it a shot haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:14 PM",No,I bet that pays off sometimes
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:14 PM",No,And you end up winning anyway

+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:15 PM",No,That wasn't fair! 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:15 PM",No,I shouldn't have called for a poll lol
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:16 PM",No,My fault I guess. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:16 PM",Yes,A non poll wouldn't have been fair.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:16 PM",No,"But it was a debate originally, the poll wasn't necessary "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:17 PM",Yes,Evidence is needed for a debate.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:16 PM",No,I thought the poll would help me out and I'd get the upper hand. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:16 PM",No,That's what I get for being sneaky. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:17 PM",Yes,Hehe
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:18 PM",No,"Well, a debate can be based on opinion. You can debate your opinion or beliefs right? "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:18 PM",No,Not in a formal setting of course...
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:20 PM",Yes,Well.. yes.. I supposed that's so. Does gender based naming conventions for lets fall under the category of opinion and beliefs though?

+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:20 PM",No,"Well, I was of the opinion that Muffin wasn't the best choice in a name for a male moth. And you were of the opinion that it was an entirely appropriate name for a male moth. So...yes?"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:22 PM",Yes,I'm not sure of my stance on this. Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:22 PM",No,"Well, they were differing opinions..."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:22 PM",No,"Not necessarily beliefs, but they were opinions. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:25 PM",Yes,I can't argue with that.

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:28 PM",Yes,"I don't think that one counts though haha. I was merely presenting a thought.\LF\LFYou know, I really like these little debate/presentations of arguments we have. I've had people tell me I'm argumentative, but I'm rarely serious. Haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,It's like a game really.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:30 PM",No,I don't see them as argumentative conversations at all. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:30 PM",No,Or like you're playing games.

+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:32 PM",No,"""Or"" was the right word. More like we're both expressing opinions that we may or may not be fully invested in and we're just taking opposing sides to see where the conversation ends up. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,"Yep, it's fun, well at least I enjoy it haha."
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,I get the feeling you like doing it too haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:34 PM",No,"I don't see anything wrong with them at all. I quite like exploring different ways of thinking, different veins of thought. "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:34 PM",No,Just as long as it doesn't turn into an actual argument and catch me completely off guard haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:36 PM",Yes,Tangent. So I was thinkin' 'bout costumes.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:36 PM",Yes,I'm considering The Dude as my costume. But I'm worried it's too simple.

+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:37 PM",No,Can you do a good Jeff Bridges impersonation?

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:39 PM",Yes,I like to think is be alright as it.

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:39 PM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:39 PM",Yes,"Yeah, but I said it out loud as I was typing so it makes it ok."

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:40 PM",Yes,I need to find a purple container of half and half though.

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:41 PM",Yes,Is it purple there??
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:41 PM",No,Purple lettering I think hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:41 PM",No,Not really the same...
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:42 PM",Yes,I think it's pink.. The container. Or are you looking at one?
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:41 PM",No,No I'm not looking. But my mom gets one from there that's purple. I think. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:41 PM",No,I don't drink coffee. So there's no half and half in my house haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:43 PM",Yes,Oh that's right. People put that stuff in coffee.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:43 PM",No,Generally

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,"Kinda seems gross, but at the same time, I don't mind ice cream in coffee. So I can't really say anything against it."
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:44 PM",Yes,Ooh found a beige robe on amazon.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:44 PM",No,That's not gross.

+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:46 PM",Yes,Oh lol. I thought you were saying you've had cream in coffee and it's not gross.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:46 PM",Yes,Ice cream isn't.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:46 PM",Yes,The idea of half and half is though. At least to me.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:49 PM",Yes,It's a matter of palette though. So definitely opinion. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:49 PM",Yes,*palate
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:49 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:48 PM",No,"Hahaha oh geez. Okay... Ice cream in coffee doesn't seem gross. Half and half in coffee is definitely gross. I would imagine heavy cream in coffee would be okay. But I don't drink coffee at all, so I wouldn't really know what any of that is like. I'm just going off of what I'm able to imagine. Coffee makes my breath feel heavy. If that makes any sense at all. Haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:50 PM",Yes,That's some heavy breath you got there.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:50 PM",No,Is it? 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:50 PM",No,Oh no. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:51 PM",Yes,Haha what?
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:50 PM",No,Do I have heavy breath? 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,I was referring to your comment about coffee making your breath feel heavy.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:52 PM",No,Oh okay
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:53 PM",Yes,I don't recall you ever smelling anything other than pleasant. Is there a deeply nested reason behind why your don't drink coffee? Or is it simple because you don't fancy it.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:53 PM",Yes,*you
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:52 PM",No,Well I'm glad I haven't reeked hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",No,I just don't fancy it. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",Yes,And I'm still not sure what you meant by heavy breath. You mean bad smelling I assume?
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",No,"Well, yes, bad smelling haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:55 PM",Yes,Or literally the air your exhale weighs more than that of the general public.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",No,Hot breath? 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",No,Maybe that the smell would weigh heavily on those around me? 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:56 PM",Yes,Ohh that's good.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:54 PM",No,The sense of breath being heavy felt right anyway
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 10:56 PM",No,I've come to discover that sometimes the way I think about certain sensory things is rather different from other people. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:58 PM",Yes,"No, that sounded good, and you presented the right idea to me. I just wanted to make sure I understood you correctly. That you weren't trying to say something else. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 10:59 PM",Yes,Such as there was a sense or feeling you were trying to convey that I lacked familiarity with.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:00 PM",No,I often think things that probably don't make immediate sense to others; as far as how I'm connecting things anyway. And then I have difficulty fully conveying the true sense of what I mean. It's quite a conundrum. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:07 PM",Yes,"Well I'm patient, and genuinely interested in fully understanding your ideas and thoughts; even though I may occasionally purposefully act like I misunderstood you. Which I apologize for.\LF\LFI, and I gather you are too, spend a lot of time in thought with myself. When you spend so much time living in your head, it's only natural for you to develop thoughts and interpretations of ideas that are unique to only you. It's kinda like having inside jokes with yourself haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:08 PM",No,Do you really sometimes pretend to misunderstand so that I have to explain? Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:09 PM",No,I never would have guessed that was the case. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:10 PM",Yes,Typically it's an obvious joke though. Like the heavy breath thing.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:10 PM",Yes,Although that one I actually did want clarification for.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,"I'm trying to think of an example. You usually ways give me a look, or say something so I know you understand I'm joking."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:11 PM",No,"I enjoy learning how you think or reason. So I will sometimes engage you in further conversation to get to the root of the thought, so to speak. So I suppose I'm guilty of the same thing, in a way, as you are. "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:11 PM",No,Do I give looks? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:12 PM",Yes,YES!
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:12 PM",No,They're probably almost always unintentional lol
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:13 PM",No,For whatever reason I'm not able to control my face very well haha
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:16 PM",Yes,"You engage me in conversation to get a better understanding. Am I aware of it when you do this? I know I attempt to acquire the same from you but I think I tend to flat out ask you what your reasoning is.\LF\LFWell your looks are awesome though, otherwise I wouldn't present such absurd misunderstandings. I guess I'm guilty of trying to fish facial expressions from you. Haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:22 PM",No,"Yes, you're aware. I hope haha. That's usually how our debates start. Because I could just let the thought go, but I want to know why and how you are thinking what you're thinking. So I'll try to keep the debate going. Or I'll just ask what you mean when you say something. I think we both do that rather often. Which I quite like. \LF\LFWell, as a forewarning, if you ever see a face you weren't fishing for and it's troublesome, just ask for clarification haha  Apparently sometimes my faces can be slightly scary "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,Scary? Have you been told this? That's kinda not cool?
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,I've never exlerienced a scary face from you. Like angry?
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:27 PM",Yes,I don't understand haha.
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:31 PM",Yes,"And on a very off topic note, I found a example family tree that clearly explains how first, second, once removed, twice removed, etc., cousins work. It's something I never really tried to understand. Would you like to see it?"
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:40 PM",No,"Yes I have been told this. On numerous occasions. Scary in the sense that the face I am wearing tends to scare off those around me. For instance, it wasn't until this last year and a half that my step-father and I knew eachother very well. He did not marry my mother until I was 20, and well after my own marriage, so I never knew him as a father figure. He was just an addition to family gatherings. And please understand I mean that in the nicest and best way possible haha. Well, obviously due to the changes I was going through in my own life, and the fact that I was temporarily living with my mother and step-father, we suddenly had the chance to get to know one another much better. After living there for about seven months, he and I were having a deep conversation about not so nice divorce related things, and also some things that had been happening at work. I was expressing to my step-father that I had been receiving some feedback that I often have a ""blank"" expression which then is interpreted as a ""bitch face"" (those were the actual words spoken to me). He said he could kind of relate to the feedback because as he was getting to know me better there were times when he would come home and I would be occupied in some way (on my phone, reading, watching a movie, etc.) but the look on my face would convey a great sense of anger. So he would automatically assume I was angry with him and would avoid me for the rest of the night. But after getting to know me better, he was less hesitant to engage me in conversation, despite the look on my face, and came to discover that often I would be busy in the act of compartmentalizing things that were going through my head and in fact wasn't even angry at anything at all, least of all with him. So he said that he could understand why people would have that feedback for me, as uncool as that feedback is, but faulted the people giving me that feedback for not making  an effort to get to know me and understand me better so that they may then be able to understand the complete lack of anger on my part. He also said that he quickly realized that I am completely unaware that I have an angry look on my face when it's there. I'm actually more serious than anything. And it takes a whole lot to make me frustrated, let alone make me angry. I don't know of any more than a handful of times when something has actually made me angry, and even then, I'm able to reduce the anger to disappointment or frustration very quickly. "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Phew! That was long winded! Sorry!
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:41 PM",No,"And yes, I'd like to see the chart. "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:42 PM",Yes,Ok you look at it while i read haha.￼
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:42 PM",No,Haha deal
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:46 PM",Yes,"Ah ok, I think I might be blind to the so called RBC. Because I've had friends who supposedly have it. I guess I've just always perceived it as a thinking face. I guess some people just can't tell the difference."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:47 PM",No,"This may be a stupid question, but, RBC? "
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:49 PM",Yes,"Resting b*tch face. It's actually a term. I was just trying to avoid writing the ""b word"" lol."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:49 PM",No,Oh haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:49 PM",No,Yeah. That's not a nice word. 
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:49 PM",No,And it wasn't said to me in a nice way. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:50 PM",Yes,"Yeah, that's why I didn't really want to type it."
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:50 PM",No,Sorry if I shouldn't have typed it. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:50 PM",Yes,You were quoting.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:50 PM",No,And that's exactly why I did type it. Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:50 PM",No,"But for me, yes, it's definitely a thinking face. "
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:51 PM",No,And unfortunately I think a whooooole lot. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:51 PM",Yes,That's not unfortunate!
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:52 PM",Yes,But I know what you mean.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:52 PM",No,"Well, only because of people misinterpreting, or rather over-interpreting, what's going on with my face haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:55 PM",Yes,Am I keeping you up?
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:56 PM",No,"No, I'm fully awake. Both eyes are open haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:58 PM",Yes,"Haha, I meant am I keeping you from going to bed and getting rested."
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:58 PM",Yes,I just don't want to keep you from getting sleep.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:58 PM",No,I know what you meant haha
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:58 PM",No,I was trying to be witty. 
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,I thought maybe.
+12103557887,"Oct 2, 2014 11:58 PM",No,I'm getting things ready for tomorrow
+17069923021,"Oct 2, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,"It was, I chuckled."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:00 AM",No,"That makes me happy. I think I can be funny sometimes, but one of my friends insists I'm not funny at all. That makes me slightly frustrated, because I think I'm hilarious! "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,What kinds of preparations?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,You are funny haha. Sometimes I have to be careful reading your texts I class lol. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:01 AM",No,"Hahaha, this might be too much information, but I'm wearing a dress tomorrow, so leg-shaving kinds of preparations..."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,*in
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:05 AM",No,I have to be careful reading your texts while eating. There have been a few times I've choked on food because of something funny you wrote haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:05 AM",Yes,I wouldn't really consider that a TMI. Actually I think there are few things I consider a TMI. Unless it's coming from a stranger haha.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:05 AM",Yes,"Oh no, don't choke haha!"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:09 AM",Yes,A TMI coming from a friend would have to be lefty gross.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:10 AM",Yes,*pretty
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:10 AM",No,"To be fair, I think I'm still getting an idea of what you gauge as too much haha. I know you're pretty conservative with a lot of things, or at least I get the sense you would prefer to be careful and not step on anyone's toes, so you err on the side of caution and are incredibly respectful. That has made me be more careful than normal because I'm generally very straightforward and blunt and just kind of say things as they are, but I'm doing my best to be respectful of you and your comfort level too. So I'm not always sure what I can, or rather, what I should say, that wouldn't make you feel uncomfortable. You know what I mean? \LF\LFAnd I think you've seen the choke I'm talking about. I'm pretty sure I've had a mouth full of food or drink at some point and had to choke it down through a fit of laughter. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:20 AM",Yes,"Haha yeah, it usually makes it that much more funny. Not to say your choking is funny. I'm just going to assume you know what I'm trying to say here.\LF\LFNow I'm trying to imagine what kinds of things you might have avoided saying to keep me from feeling uncomfortable lol. I'm not sure using my imagination here is such a great idea haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:22 AM",No,"I know what you're saying haha\LF\LFAnd yes, refrain from imagining what I might have said lol"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,"See now I'm just kinda lost, conservative can be used in so many different contexts."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,Lol
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:25 AM",Yes,"I'd ask you to provide an example, but then you might worry about offending me haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:26 AM",No,Oh geez 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:26 AM",No,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:26 AM",No,Conservative in that you seem to hold traditional beliefs and values. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:28 AM",No,That you're rather careful and proper. And do your best to be cautious about what you say and how other people might interpret your words and actions. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:28 AM",No,That you want to treat everyone with the utmost respect and you do your best to be uncommonly kind to all those around you. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:30 AM",No,"Conservative in that you are careful about what you share with others, not because you are secretive, but because you are selective about who gets to see all of you, in a good way. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:30 AM",No,Better? Or more confusing?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:31 AM",Yes,Definite clearer.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:30 AM",No,Accurate?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:32 AM",Yes,Very much so.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:30 AM",No,Good
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:33 AM",No,I find it difficult to read people. So I'm glad I wasn't too far off. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:33 AM",Yes,I'm still not exactly sure what this has to do with shaving your legs though. Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:34 AM",Yes,Because it's something typically not done in public?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:34 AM",No,Grooming can be a somewhat personal thing haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:34 AM",Yes,Ah ok. That makes sense.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:34 AM",No,I could've said I was taking a bath! Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:35 AM",No,Would that have given a different sense? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:35 AM",Yes,I don't think so.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:36 AM",No,"Well, I wasn't sure if it would or not, so I tried to be funny with the ""leg-shaving kinds of preparations"" bit. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:38 AM",Yes,"So now I'm even more confused, were you actually taking a bath? Or shaving your legs? And how in the world did you perform either whilst texting me?? Haha. How many hands do you have?"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:40 AM",No,"I was actually doing both. Taking a bath, and shaving both legs whilst in said bath. And my phone was on the bathroom floor. I would dry off my hands to text in between shaving. And it's still just the two hands. Haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:40 AM",No,I'm a girl. We multi-task that stuff. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:41 AM",Yes,That's quite impressive. I would be worried about dropping my phone in the water.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:41 AM",No,I never held it over the water though. I would reach over the side of the bathtub. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:41 AM",No,It's not all that impressive. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:43 AM",Yes,Well I guess the impressiveness level is purely dependent on the difference of time between a texting bath and a non-texting bath.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:44 AM",Yes,"If the deviation is minute, then it would be."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:44 AM",No,The length of the bath you mean? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:44 AM",Yes,Yes.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:45 AM",No,It was pretty much the same. And I was in the bath while I texted the novel about the faces I make. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:46 AM",No,"I can type pretty fast though, if I'm not having to scroll back to reference a question and I'm just typing an original thought stream/story. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:49 AM",Yes,Is your dress wearing tomorrow for any specific reason or simply because.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:49 AM",No,Just because.  
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:49 AM",No,"It's a dress I haven't worn to work before because it's kind of a fall dress and tomorrow is apparently supposed to be chilly, so I'm gonna wear the dress. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:51 AM",No,But that made me look at the weather forecast for tomorrow and it says 88 degrees haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:51 AM",No,Oh well...
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:52 AM",Yes,"lol,"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:53 AM",Yes,So just to clarify.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:54 AM",No,"It's not a thick dress, the colors are more fall colors. Maybe I should give that detail..."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:55 AM",Yes,"So chilly goes with fall and with the colors, not necasarily because the dress is a warm one lol."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:54 AM",No,Yes. Hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:55 AM",Yes,*necessarily oh that spelling
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:54 AM",No,My thought process is strange I guess. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:56 AM",No,What's considered chilly here in Texas isn't really chilly to me anyway though. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:56 AM",Yes,Well I clearly came to the correct conclusion. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding you.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:56 AM",No,Chilly here is 70 degrees. Chilly to me is 48 degrees or so. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:57 AM",Yes,I was about to have epiphany regarding the thermodynamics of dresses lol.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:56 AM",No,I find that you rarely misunderstand me haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:58 AM",No,"That would be an interesting thesis... ""The Thermodynamics of Fall Dresses and Their Seasonal Counterparts"" "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 12:58 AM",No,"Whoo boy, I'm getting loopy Hahahaha "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 12:59 AM",Yes,I just thought you should know. That was indeed funny. And I had an audible reaction to it.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:00 AM",No,Hahahahahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:00 AM",No,I know it's a problem when I start laughing at my own jokes though Hahahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:02 AM",Yes,Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:03 AM",Yes,"Hey, being able to make yourself laugh is an ability not everyone has lol."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:03 AM",No,I made myself crack up laughing at work today. I was laughing so hard I started crying and I couldn't stop for a good twenty minutes! Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:03 AM",No,"Oh, I know I'm a fool hahaha"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:03 AM",No,And I'm totally okay with it
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:04 AM",No,￼
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:04 AM",Yes,Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:04 AM",No,My sister just sent me that. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:05 AM",No,I think sometimes she forgets that there's a two hour time difference lol
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:06 AM",No,"Yesterday I was giving her a hard time about the amount of selfies she's been posting and she waited five hours to send me her reply, at two in the morning our time..."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:06 AM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:06 AM",No,And it was this 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:07 AM",Yes,I... I don't even. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:07 AM",No,Zoom in on the phone he's holding Hahahaha 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:08 AM",Yes,What?? Hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:08 AM",No,Hahahahahahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:08 AM",Yes,That's such a stretch of a reference. Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:09 AM",No,What he's saying? Or how he's holding a phone case of Han Solo frozen in carbonite?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:09 AM",Yes,What he's saying lol.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:10 AM",No,"Well, not reeeeeally... The original line is ""you may fire when ready"""
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:10 AM",No,They just switched out one word...
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:11 AM",Yes,"I know, but but..."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:11 AM",No,"I mean, it didn't have me rolling on the floor in stitches or anything. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:11 AM",No,It was silly to me because that was her response to my criticism 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:12 AM",Yes,That's kind of why I find it funny. The correlation between fire and selfie.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:12 AM",Yes,Or lack thereof.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:12 AM",No,Fire...shoot...click...photo...selfie 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:13 AM",No,It goes from word to sound and back to a different word. See the progression? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:13 AM",No,"*back to a different word from the same sound, I mean"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:14 AM",Yes,"What if it was a guy being interviews... And he was like... ""You may hire when ready."""
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:14 AM",Yes,My eyes are laughing.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",No,Would there be something else funny about the interviewing? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",No,I see your point completely though 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",Yes,Same guy.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",Yes,With his Han phone
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",Yes,Peeking out of his pants pocket
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",No,And I'm not arguing against the absurdity of the phrase being used in the way it is. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:15 AM",No,The phrase isn't really very funny. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:16 AM",No,It was totally funny only because she was trying to answer my ridicule for all the selfies she's been taking with that meme alone
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:17 AM",No,Because she was trying to win the argument with a General Tarkin meme
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:19 AM",No,Haha we're all just a family of nerds anyway
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:19 AM",Yes,Wait... So she didn't win?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:19 AM",No,Do you think she did?  
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:21 AM",No,I don't know that we decided ourselves. I think we just moved on to something else. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:22 AM",Yes,"Well maybe by sending something so silly, she was saying she thought what you said was silly."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:23 AM",No,Possibly. There's no telling with her though. She's a different girl. \LFAnd on that note...I'm thinking it's time to call it quits for the night. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:23 AM",Yes,I am semi delirious right now. So... That yes.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:24 AM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:24 AM",No,I should try for at least four hours of sleep I think
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:25 AM",Yes,Thanks for spending phone time with me tonight haha. I had a lot of fun.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:25 AM",No,"I always enjoy talking with you. Whether it's through texts, or using actual voices. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:25 AM",Yes,Or telepathy.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:25 AM",No,"You know, as opposed to the ones in our heads..."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",No,Or telepathy. Yes. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",No,That too. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",Yes,Ha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",No,"By the way, I realized I text you in a British accent haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:27 AM",Yes,That's so random lol
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",No,"That is to say, that when I read it back, the voice in my head is British "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:26 AM",No,Yeah. Random. I don't even know why or where it started. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:27 AM",Yes,"If anything, I feel like I should read I. Australian."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:27 AM",No,But it's a nice voice anyway. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",No,"No no, MY voice is British. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",No,"When I read back what I've texted, I read it back (in my head) with an accent "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",Yes,Oh you said read it back. So I thought you meant when you type to me AND when I respond. I reread and understand now.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",No,Hahaha 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",No,Oh Lordy it's late 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:29 AM",Yes,Yeah.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:28 AM",No,I'll say goodnight and let you sleep. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,And I shall sleep as well. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",Yes,I actually have stuff I have to finish for school.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",Yes,But yes.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",Yes,Soon
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,Oh no! Really? I'm so sorry 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,I feel bad now. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",Yes,"No it was my bad, I didn't realize till a few minutes ago."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:31 AM",Yes,I checked online.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,"Well, get to it and then get to bed after "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:31 AM",Yes,"Don't feel bad, it isn't your fault in any way."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:31 AM",Yes,Okies
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,Have a good night Andrew 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:31 AM",Yes,Goodnight Jessie. Dream of fluffy penguins and midget giraffes.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:30 AM",No,Hahaha I'll do my best
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 1:32 AM",Yes,=P
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 1:32 AM",No,"Let me know what the weekend plans are when you've figured them out. And again, goodnight. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 2:52 PM",Yes,Do we have to start early if we're to go to enchanted rock? I'm actually not sure where it is.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:01 PM",No,It depends on how long you want to be out there. It's about 25 minutes past Fredericksburg. It took about an hour and a half to get there last time. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:13 PM",Yes,"It's looking like I'm going to have to go in for that shift tomorrow. it's 12-430. That would probably be too late right? What if we movied and gamed tomorrow, and hiked Sunday. Would that work?"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:18 PM",No,That's perfectly fine with me. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:19 PM",No,Were you wanting to do movies and games at my place? Or yours?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:31 PM",Yes,Either is fine. I could drive out to you so you don't have to drive so much.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:30 PM",No,Hahaha not gonna be the one to fully decide huh? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:33 PM",Yes,Haha you know Im so bad at that.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:33 PM",No,That's why I called you out on it hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:33 PM",No,Yeah. Let's do my place this time. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:33 PM",No,Easier?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:34 PM",Yes,"Haha, I was about to make some complex decision making process, but you made a decision lol. Your place works for me."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:35 PM",Yes,Did you ever get a doormat?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:36 PM",No,I'll let it slide this time haha. Next time you're gonna be the one to decide. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:36 PM",No,"Yeah, I got a doormat. Kind of... I'm keeping it inside haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:37 PM",Yes,What? It's supposed to be outside lol.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:37 PM",No,"Well, I dunno then hahaha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 3:37 PM",Yes,"You know they have the door at at target that have ""Welcome"" written in several languages."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 3:38 PM",No,"No, I didn't haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 4:00 PM",Yes,"I considered getting it cause I knew you needed a doormat, but I figured a doormat is one of those things that shouldn't be a surprise lol."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 4:15 PM",No,"Well if it makes you feel better, I got you a housewarming gift too haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 4:40 PM",Yes,Aww thanks. So is a language doormat something you would like? Or do you plan on putting that other one outside at some point? I wanted to get you a house warming gift too. But I didn't know what you needed lol. I guess I could've asked.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 4:41 PM",No,"You don't have to get me anything. But if you wanted to, then the doormat would be entirely appropriate and would fulfill my doormat needs haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 5:25 PM",Yes,Haha.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 5:26 PM",Yes,Ok so the current plan is to head over to you after work. If somehow a miracle happens and I don't end up going in tomorrow would you like to go to enchanted rock tomorrow?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 5:28 PM",No,I'm really down for whatever. I can be flexible this weekend. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 7:01 PM",Yes,￼We're all cleaning matts apartment.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 7:20 PM",Yes,Oh and I thought you might find this interesting too lol. ￼
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 7:43 PM",No,"Look at you helping your friend out haha \LFIs it because you weren't able to help him move on Wednesday? So you're helping him clean now? You're a good friend. \LF\LFAnd yes, that is interesting haha. Why did you pick ""interesting"" though? Haha that seems more deliberate than ""I thought you might like this"" "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 7:48 PM",Yes,"Haha actually no. He moved today, I've been over here since I got home from class at 11. Helped him move everything, hooked up his internet and TV stuff, and offered to clean. It's been quite a day. But he helped me quite a bit with mine and Kris's move; as did you ma'am.\LF\LFHaha well yeah. I immediately thought of you when I saw it. lol "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,I picked interesting because... Hmm
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 7:49 PM",Yes,I'm not sure.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 7:53 PM",No,"Oh, I thought he was moving on Wednesday. But that's impressive that the unit is completely clear and being cleaned after just eight hours of moving. Awesome job team! Hahaha and that's even nicer of you to reciprocate the help. You really are a good friend. \LF\LFI was thinking I might have been overthinking the use of ""interesting"", but I wanted to check anyway. But I would think of me too if I had seen them myself haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 7:55 PM",No,I'm thinking that I'll probably be up cleaning for a bit as well. I'm going to try to hang all of my pictures. That's the last thing I have to do to be settled in. So we'll see how that goes. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:08 PM",No,￼But I won't be getting any help with cleaning from my housemates tonight haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:16 PM",Yes,"I got a couple replies, ""Thanks LOD"", ""Thanks mom"". I got some free food out of it though. Which was nice. Except when we got home we found out they hadn't put mine or Sarah's food in out bags.\LF\LFWell you do put a lot of value in words, so that's understandable. I think I was more focused in delivering the picture than finding the best wording.\LF\LFWhat kinda of pictures do you have? Is it all family stuff? Or artworks?"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,And he's such a fluffy little cutie!
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:17 PM",Yes,"He's totally helpful, he's a mood booster."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:18 PM",No,"Wait, you told them what I said?! Hahahaha oh no"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:19 PM",Yes,"Haha, ""Awesome job team"" is kinda directed at a group lol."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:19 PM",Yes,I felt it fitting.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:19 PM",No,And that's unfortunate about the food. That's always very disappointing. Being excited about food and then not getting to eat any. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:19 PM",No,"Well, I was being silly haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:20 PM",Yes,We ended up driving back to get food. They gave us some free drinks to say sorry.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:20 PM",No,"I have photos, paintings. Photos I took, paintings I painted, and several paintings my grandmother painted. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:20 PM",No,That's good about the food then!
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:23 PM",No,"And the ""thanks mom"" was from Matt, wasn't it? "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,I would like to see those. I'm kinda excited about seeing your place. Getting familiar with new environments is quite stimulating.￼They're arguing about the food haha.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,Yes!!
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:29 PM",Yes,It totally was Matt!
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:29 PM",No,Figured haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:29 PM",No,Am I really that much of a motherly figure? Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:33 PM",Yes,Apparently Matt thinks so. Haha. I mean you are a mother.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:33 PM",No,Being a mother isn't quite the same as being a motherly figure though haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:35 PM",Yes,Oh my texts never sent.. Let me resend them.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:36 PM",Yes,That's a good point. But it is easier to see a motherly person as a motherly figure. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:38 PM",No,"Well, either way you'll be able to see them at some point this weekend haha. And I'm sure you'll be able to learn quite a bit about me from my house. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 8:39 PM",Yes,I'm feeling pretty stylish. ￼
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:38 PM",No,They're so sweet. They seem very well made for eachother. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:40 PM",No,I'm willing to argue you on this motherly bit haha. I've seen many mothers who are decidedly unmotherly. And several motherly figures who are childless. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 8:40 PM",No,What happened to your feet? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:16 PM",Yes,"Haha, learn from you by seeing your house? Is that supposed to mean something? Like am I going to find out you're a slob? lol.\LF\LFAnd are you talking about Matt and Sarah? Yeah they were under quite a bit of pressure, and we're being a little snarky occasionally. But they seemed like they were working it out and not getting aggressive.\LF\LFAnd I would argue that simply having children doesn't make someone a mother. Is that too harsh? To me, being a mother isn't simply a title given to those who have had children. There's a level of responsibility and love involved to be worthy of the title. \LF\LFAnd these are my bag shoes! ￼\LFWe had a lot of target bags for things. At one point I didn't have shoes and I didn't want to ruin my socks, so I started sporting them."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:07 PM",Yes,My texts aren't sending for some reason.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:10 PM",No,No? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:10 PM",No,Should I reset my phone? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:13 PM",Yes,It's probably me lol.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:13 PM",Yes,It says it's sti trying to send stuff.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:16 PM",No,Well I reset it anyway. Just in case haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,"It's weird, I seemed to be getting all your stuff just fine."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,But all my outgoing stuff would just stall.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:17 PM",Yes,Haha it's working fine now.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:21 PM",Yes,"So did this send? \LF\LFHaha, learn from you by seeing your house? Is that supposed to mean something? Like am I going to find out you're a slob? lol.\LF\LFAnd are you talking about Matt and Sarah? Yeah they were under quite a bit of pressure, and we're being a little snarky occasionally.

To me, being a mother isn't simply a title given to those who have had children. There's a level of responsibility and love involved to be worthy of the title. \LF\LFAnd these are my bag shoes! "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:24 PM",No,"Well, you'll be able to get a better idea of my interests, some of my past, and my tastes. Do you think I would be a slob? Haha\LF\LFYes, I meant Matt and Sarah. And I wasn't being sarcastic at all. I've always thought they were absolutely cute together. \LF\LFI agree with that sentiment about mothers, but it was sounding like you were saying that mothers were automatically more likely to be seen as motherly. So I was about to get a bit testy about what makes a mother a mother haha\LF\LFWhy didn't you have shoes? Hahahaha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:31 PM",Yes,"I wouldn't think you are... But then again I haven't seen your place yet. =P\LF\LFAh, no I didn't mean women with kids are more motherly. It's kind of like a word conflict. Mother can mean a physical relationship or a woman who nurtures, cares for, guides, etc. I usually mean the latter.\LF\LFMatt stuffed my shoes in a trashcan. Haha I didn't know where they were."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:35 PM",No,"Well, I'll let you make your judgments then, and see what the prognosis is after the viewing haha\LF\LFOkay, that makes more sense then about what you were trying to say about mothers. And I am appeased haha\LF\LFYou guys are goofy. Hiding shoes...hahaha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:39 PM",Yes,Hey! lol I'm not judging. I'm reasoning deductively. Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 9:41 PM",Yes,So did you still wear your dress today even though it wasn't chilly?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 9:49 PM",No,"Isn't walking through someone's home and attempting to discern a bit more about them some form of judgment though? Not necessarily a bad judgment, but still a judgment none-the-less... Maybe? \LF\LFAnd yes, I still wore the dress. Apparently the outfit was quite ""classy"" haha. So I guess the outfit was a success. Or at least that's what I was told by some random stranger when I made a trip to the store haha. "
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:04 PM",Yes,Oh that's what you meant. Ok. Well I will be developing theories on your behavior and character based on the state of your home. Lol\LF\LFSomeone said you look classy? Haha not that that's a surprise.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,What did it look like? I thought you said blue. Are to fall colors brown and orange?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:05 PM",Yes,*arent
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:07 PM",No,"No, I only said fall colors haha, no blue. It was black with orange, maroon, and white triangles. I wore it with a cream, maroon, and orange scarf and black heeled ankle boots. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:07 PM",No,It's not a surprise that I would look classy? Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:07 PM",No,You usually only see me in jeans lol
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:09 PM",No,And that's not very classy attire
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:09 PM",No,And I would fully expect for you to base all kinds of theories based off of what's in my house haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:17 PM",Yes,"No, I mean I was trying to say that I wasn't saying you being classy was unheard of. That's really hard to explain through a text. Regardless, I've seen you look pretty classy before haha. I love your scarves! \LF\LFWhere in the world did I get blue from then? haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:17 PM",Yes,I will make lots of theories. But I'll probably voice them to you.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:18 PM",Yes,"Also if I suddenly stop responding it's because my phone is close to dying haha. I haven't even called anyone today, or used internet. Just texting haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:18 PM",No,"I have many many many scarves. I used to be a hat person, but it's been scarves now for quite some time haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:18 PM",No,"And voice all the theories and opinions you like, I'll be sure to respond appropriately. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:20 PM",No,I'll let you give your phone a break then. Let me know what the plan is for tomorrow when you have the chance. Have a good night Andrew! And try to get some sleep at some point haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,"I'm surprised you wear them through the summer though. I would think they're a bit warm, even though they're quite thin.\LF\LFWait you're bailing? I kinda wanted to drive my battery into the ground."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:21 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:22 PM",No,I'm not bailing haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:22 PM",No,I thought you were politely signing off
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:22 PM",No,They've warm-ish haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:23 PM",No,*they're
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:23 PM",No,"The scarves are, that is..."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:25 PM",Yes,"I would probably tell you that I'm leaving because I need to conserve battery. Instead of saying.. In case I don't respond, this is why."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:26 PM",Yes,"I may avoid stepping on toes, but I'm pretty straightforward when it comes to explaining things... I think at least."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:26 PM",No,"Oh. Well, I interpreted it wrong then "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:28 PM",No,I was thinking that maybe you were wanting to save a bit of juice in case of an emergency or something haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:28 PM",Yes,"Well it was a pretty good theory, given you don't know my present situation. I could have been alone and distant from my house."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:29 PM",No,"Hey, I'm all about safety haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,"...I'm gonna take a poke at it, and guess that was lightly slathered in facetious."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:30 PM",Yes,That kinda sounds gross.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:32 PM",No,"Well, I actually do want to make sure that people are safe, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm always as safe as I could be..."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,"Yeah, whereas I see safety issues wherever I look."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,Danger is my middle name.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:33 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:33 PM",No,Oh I don't know about that haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:34 PM",No,I've seen you be pretty careful before
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:34 PM",Yes,Yeah. But I do things when other people aren't at risk.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:35 PM",No,I suppose that's fair then. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:35 PM",No,We're both guilty of the same thing 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:39 PM",Yes,Wait so what dangerous things have you done??
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:39 PM",No,Just not paying attention to what I'm doing at all times. Like choosing to let go of a rock wall at 15 feet up because I thought the mat would catch me just fine. That wasn't really thinking the choice through all the way jaha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:39 PM",No,*haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:42 PM",Yes,"Haha, so your subconscious is the thrill seeker then. Lol"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:42 PM",Yes,You don't even know you're about to be thrown on an adventure haha.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:42 PM",Yes,Or dropped on an adventure.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:43 PM",No,Yeah. That's probably true. I'll typically realize I made a bad decision halfway through and at that point it's too late to do anything about it haha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:52 PM",Yes,"Man, I'm so burnt out. I can't wait to finally get home to shower and eat something."
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 10:53 PM",No,How much longer do you have?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:54 PM",Yes,We're unloading the trunk now lol. Just got groceries.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 10:54 PM",Yes,Mine and Kris's first grocery trip together haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:00 PM",No,Haha how exciting! I know how you love those excursions.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:00 PM",No,Get anything good?
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:17 PM",Yes,Haha I really do!
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Nothing fancy just some sandwich stuff.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Gotcha. 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,And some ground beef.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,For mini burbs
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Burgers*
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Lol
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",No,Hahahahaha 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",No,That sounds like an interesting foray into the food world 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:18 PM",Yes,Yeah I like to throw a few burbs on the grill every once in a while.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:19 PM",Yes,"Foray, unfamiliar word alert!"
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:20 PM",No,I'm using it in the sense that you'd be trying something new with food that you'd never tried before. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:21 PM",No,"You're venturing into new food territory, so to speak. "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:22 PM",No,It's typically used as a term for an attack or a raid in order to gain something. But it can also be used to describing a new venture. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:22 PM",No,*describe
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,And I don't have to work tomorrow!!!!!!!!
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:33 PM",Yes,I am so flipping happy!
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:33 PM",No,Hahaha sleeping in? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:33 PM",No,Who took your shift? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:35 PM",Yes,"Because of the food i was buying? Or because I was shopping with Kris.\LF\LFAnd I'm happy because we can go to enchanted tomorrow! Unless you rather do that Sunday. I don't know who took my shift. Jimmy just said I don't have to work tomorrow, and that I owe him big time haha."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:36 PM",Yes,We could still go Sunday.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:37 PM",No,Because you said you were making mini burbs. I took it way out to left field haha. \LF\LFWe can go tomorrow. That's perfectly fine with me. When were you wanting to head out? 
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:41 PM",Yes,"I would love to put my foot down and make a decision, but seeing as though I've never been.. I don't feel like my decision would be best. Would it be beneficial to leave in the morning? I just don't have a great grasp on the time frame."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,And my credit card got compromised today too. That was a fun surprise.
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Compromised how? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Should I drive to your place? And we leave from there tomorrow?
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:45 PM",No,It's up I-10. 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:45 PM",No,Past Boerne and then past Fredericksburg. Pl
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:45 PM",No,"Take the ""pl"" out haha I was trying to hit send lol"
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:50 PM",Yes,I was going to say I can come to you. But that's kinda backtracking now that I know where it is haha. I just feel bad having you use all that gas.\LF\LFAnd supposedly my bank suspected activity on my card that wasn't me. So they decided to send me a new card... Which went to my old address. And someone spent 16 bucks on an Audible book today using it... Which I've been moving a day.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:51 PM",No,That's rather odd. Who do you bank through? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:51 PM",No,Old address as in your old apartment? 
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:52 PM",No,And either way we'll be backtracking a bit. From my place or yours haha
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:54 PM",No,"If we're hiking tomorrow and doing movies and games at my place on Sunday, then I can drive to yours tomorrow and you can drive to mine on Sunday. Fair? "
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:58 PM",No,￼
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:58 PM",No,I was poking Charlie with one his whiskers that fell out hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:58 PM",Yes,"USAA, this isn't the first time they've done this. I mean, I don't mind them being careful. I just wish I could have had the option to be like, ""Please don't send it yet, I'm moving."" The timing was just bad, yet perfect at the same time. At least I'm not responsible for the charge. That's a reason I love USAA.\LF\LFYeah my old apartment. I'm guessing someone got it out of the mail. New tenant? That's kinda fast though. I wouldn't have thought anyone moved in yet."
+17069923021,"Oct 3, 2014 11:59 PM",Yes,That's sounds fair.
+12103557887,"Oct 3, 2014 11:59 PM",No,That's really strange. Very fast for fraudulent activity. But it's good that the bank doesn't hold you accountable. 
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:00 AM",Yes,Wait you weren't feeding him? Haha that was a whisker?? lol
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:00 AM",No,No food involved. He was trying to grab the whisker out of my hand hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:01 AM",Yes,He is adorable.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:00 AM",No,￼And I must have made him mad cause now he's moping hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:00 AM",No,I just took the video right now
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:02 AM",No,Yeah I made him mad haha now he's biting my wrist 
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,"I saw your nail being illuminated slightly by the light, and I thought you were holding a vitamin as capsule lol."
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:03 AM",Yes,Teasing him with vitamins
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:02 AM",No,Haha no my nails are just kind of long right now
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:04 AM",No,Can you tell what I'm watching? Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:05 AM",No,"From the background noise in the video, I mean. "
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:08 AM",Yes,I hear Bugs and Yosemite.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:09 AM",No,Hahaha yeah... Looney Tunes. 
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:09 AM",No,I put it on as background noise while I was hanging pictures 
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:11 AM",Yes,"Haha, I haven't watched that stuff in a while."
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:11 AM",No,It's pretty classic haha
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:13 AM",No,"Okay, so we've decided that tomorrow I'll drive to yours. Why don't we plan on leaving sometime after lunch? Say around 12:30 or 1? Is that okay? Or were you wanting to go earlier than that? "
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:19 AM",Yes,"I had a tiny toons video tape I used to watch a lot as a kid. How I spent my summer vacation. It was so good. I ended up finding a copy of it. It's on my server now.\LF\LFSo when Kris and I were helping Matt move, we were in Matt's truck and ""Sometimes When We Touch"" came on the radio. So Kris and I started singing it all dramatic-like trying to weird Matt out. As a joke we've been singing it all day. But now we keep randomly singing it without even thinking. ""I wanna hold you till I diiiee!!! Till we both breakdown and cry!!!"" It's starting to get annoying. But we can't get it out of our head.\LF\LFAnd that time sounds fine. I take it we'll fuel up our bodies individually before hand? I'll prolly stash a sandwich in my camelback too haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:22 AM",No,"Yeah, I've got some errands to run first thing in the morning and a quick project to finish real fast. We could eat on the way if you wanted, or yes, we could eat individually and then pack sustenance for the duration of the excursion. What do you think you'd prefer to do? "
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:23 AM",No,And I'm gonna have to google that song cause right now I can't pull it out of my direct memory. 
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:24 AM",No,"But I'm sure Matt appreciated the theatrics, even if you and Kris are paying the price for it still with the song being stuck haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:33 AM",Yes,I'm going to probably eat something brief in the morning. Maybe cereal and a sandwich or something. Was eating on the road something you were wanting to do? I honestly am really bad at predicting my stomach behavior. Sometimes he just gets super hungry out of nowhere.\LF\LF￼And this is the song haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:36 AM",No,Haha I'm just determined to force you into making a decision at some point hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:36 AM",No,"Okay, yeah. I know the song. "
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:36 AM",Yes,Haha
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:36 AM",No,And that's an unfortunate one to have stuck in your head.  
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:37 AM",Yes,Did you hear us at the end? And what?? That's an amazing song!!
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:38 AM",Yes,Ok how about lets eat before hand. And if one or both of us gets surprised by hunger we'll grab something.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:38 AM",No,Did you do some big finish? I didn't hear a big finish. 
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:38 AM",Yes,We just started singing halfway through.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:38 AM",No,Hahaha thank you for being decisive. And that sounds fine to me. 
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:39 AM",No,Maybe on the way back we can stop at the food truck place off of 46 near Boerne. They've got like five or six food trucks there every weekend. 
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:39 AM",No,It's called Point Place or something like that. 
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:39 AM",No,I've always wanted to go try it out. 
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:44 AM",Yes,"And I'm about to make another decision! Look you've created a monster! I need a shower and I want to unload a few more boxes before bed. And given our texting history, that might not happen unless one of us makes an executive decision haha. So I'm gonna prolly sign off. (See? Very straightforward)\LF\LFI'd be up for that. I don't have a whole ton of experience with food trucks, save the once or twice I've had my brother bring stuff home while in Portlandia. That would be fun."
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:45 AM",Yes,Plus sleep before a day of physical activity is good. And you got like none last night. So make me feel better by getting some sleep tonight haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:47 AM",No,"Look at you! This is definitely not a monster-type situation at all though haha\LFI'm good with signing off too. I've got just a couple things left to complete and then it's bed for me as well. \LF\LFHopefully the good trucks will be worth it then! \LF\LFSo then I'll say: goodnight, sweet dreams, and I'll see you in the morning Andrew! "
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:53 AM",Yes,"Sleep well, Jessie... And I was about to lay down the Dread Pirate Roberts line. But I felt really weird saying ""I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" So aptly I abandoned ship. But yes, defragment your brain with some pleasant REM sleep... Goodnight Jessie."
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:53 AM",No,Hahaha I would've understood the reference though. Goodnight!
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 11:53 AM",Yes,Hey do you think we could take your car up? I ask because my car is way overdue for an oil change and I keep getting warning lights for my fire pressure. I haven't had time during the weekdays to get it taken care of. I think Monday I'll finally be able to in between class. I can pay for gas!
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 11:54 AM",No,"Yeah, we can take my car of course! And don't worry about the gas. Haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:38 PM",No,"Okay, I'm on my way. Did your gate code change? "
+17069923021,"Oct 4, 2014 12:40 PM",Yes,"Nope, should still be the same. I should be good to go by the time you get here."
+12103557887,"Oct 4, 2014 12:40 PM",No,Okay. See you in a bit!
+17069923021,"Oct 5, 2014 11:49 AM",Yes,Hey is 230-3ish alright? Or too early?
+12103557887,"Oct 5, 2014 11:51 AM",No,"No, that's perfectly fine. I'm just sweeping and vacuuming and that's all I've got going on haha"
+12103557887,"Oct 5, 2014 12:57 PM",No,"You probably need the address though, huh? \LF\LF13031 Park Crossing #604\LFSan Antonio, TX 78217\LF\LFThey're called the Park Greene Townhomes. You'll turn left to where the office is and on your right is the gate. Enter in 024 and I'll dial you in. \LF\LFPark right next to me (straight and then left at the curve) in space number 25. I'm in building 6, all the way at the end of the building #604. \LF\LFIf you want me to give you directions for how to get here, I can do that, or Siri can take you to Venezuela. Which may be more fun anyway haha. "
+17069923021,"Oct 5, 2014 1:27 PM",Yes,Yes she's troublesome. I think I'll be alright up until I get within 2 miles. That's usually when I get lost haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 5, 2014 1:31 PM",No,"Okay, it's pretty easy actually...\LF-Take 1604 East \LF-Exit Redland Road\LF-Take a right on Redland Road\LF-Take a right on Jones Maltsberger\LF-Take a left on Thousand Oaks (you'll go about five miles or so)\LF-After you go over the railroad tracks, you'll take a left on Park Crossing at the Citgo\LF-Park Greene Townhomes are on your left \LF\LFIt should be a total of 23 miles or so, it's pretty easy to get here, but I don't know if Siri will take you the same way...\LF"
+17069923021,"Oct 5, 2014 2:39 PM",Yes,I ran into issues turning my rent in at the office because they were closed. Had to find an envelope so I could drop it in the box with my proof of insurance. But I'm just about to rollout! So I might be a smidge late.
+12103557887,"Oct 5, 2014 2:40 PM",No,"It's fine, I'm not going anywhere haha"
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 12:36 AM",Yes,"I forgot to thank you for another amazing dinner. =) So.. Thank you for that, and the lovely foxy gifts. This was the relaxing weekend I needed to relieve my work and school related anxieties. I've had quite a lot of fun with you."
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 12:39 AM",No,"The dinner wasn't all me. It was half you too haha. But you're still welcome for that and for the gifts as well. And likewise, thank you for my new welcome mat! This weekend was very fun and I think I needed it just as much as you did. Thank you for being willing to do things with me. I always have a good time. "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 12:56 AM",Yes,Well I'm more than willing haha. Good night Jessie.
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 12:56 AM",No,And I'm glad you are haha. Good night Andrew. 
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 12:52 PM",Yes,And Words With Friends totally counts as a video game just so you know. ;D
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 12:50 PM",No,How? Haha
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 1:07 PM",Yes,"It's a game in there is a digital interface between everything that is accepted as input from your hands/voice and what it then presented to your your senses; eyes, ears, etc. Whereas with a physical game, there is no interface with the pieces or board. Every action you make is directly affecting objects in space, which you can then perceive with your eyes and ears."
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 1:20 PM",No,So technical haha
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 1:20 PM",No,Did you just want to be able to make me feel better about my virtual gaming abilities? 
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 1:20 PM",No,"Or rather, my use of electronic materials? "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 1:29 PM",Yes,I wanted to spur your gaming confidence a bit. lol
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 1:31 PM",No,Aw thanks! I still don't think it counts the same though. Wait till we play one with video game controllers and try to boost my confidence again at that point haha
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 2:46 PM",Yes,Haha ok. I still think you'll be alright if I start you off on something slow paced.
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 2:46 PM",Yes,And would you like to play another game of words?
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 2:48 PM",No,"I may be okay with a slower video game, yes. And you promised you'd be nice and not make fun of me, so I probably wouldn't be as self-conscious about it. \LF\LFAnd I already started another game haha\LF\LFI'm totally down to people-listen haha. It may be harder to do that than it is to people watch though "
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:02 PM",No,I found our South African Pigeon-Swallow!! Kind of....it's called the Mascarene Martin hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 3:08 PM",Yes,Is it because it looks like a pigeon swallow? Or because it shares some migratory characteristic of out pigeon swallow? Lol
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:09 PM",No,Both haha 
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:09 PM",No,Did you look it up to see? 
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:15 PM",No,There's a town in Liberia called Sasstown. Thought that was interesting...
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 3:20 PM",Yes,"I did look it up lol. And you've got to be kidding me! Really?  Sasstown? We might have to send you there! Haha. Wait... By saying that, does that mean I have to go now too?"
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:31 PM",No,Sending me to Sasstown? In Liberia? In the middle of the Ebola epidemic? And just because I'm sassy? Do you want to get rid of me that badly? Hahahaha and am I really all that sassy? Hahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:31 PM",No,"And yes, now you have to go with me. "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 3:55 PM",Yes,"I typed that up, then I stopped and thought about it. I've never experienced heavy sass from you. But I'm pretty sure you've been cheeky on occasion, which I figured was enough haha. But yeah I'd rather you not be exposed to the elements of Liberia against your will. So you have permission I stay haha."
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 3:58 PM",No,Haha fair enough. I'll take cheeky. And a lot of my humor is certainly very tongue-in-cheek. So that fits. I just thought the name was hilarious. And thank you for the permission to avoid risking  contracting a deadly infectious disease haha
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 5:17 PM",No,"So it's probably a good thing the tire tore the way it did. Apparently the last time they balanced the tires, they messed it up. The other front tire was starting to tear as well. And also there's a nail in my back driver side tire. And the back passenger side tire's tread is messed up because of the balance being off too. So I'm getting two new tires today for sure, potentially a third because of the nail, and the fourth will be replaced next month. Sigh. But at least we are safe and nothing really dangerous happened to us. "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 5:39 PM",Yes,"All things work together for good. That's definitely great to find out ahead of time, instead of having something happen to us.\LF\LFSo was most of it covered under warranty? Did your mom take it to get looked at?"
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 5:43 PM",No,"Yeah, the night could have ended very differently. \LF\LFNone of it was covered under the warranty.  Apparently the warranty I bought only covered nails and tire manufacturing problems. So I'm having to buy the tires new. And my mom wasn't able to take the car. I'm actually here right now getting it fixed. "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 5:45 PM",Yes,"Well that's stinks, I'm sorry to hear that."
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 5:48 PM",Yes,"Are they super expensive? My mom wanted me to pay for her tired when I tore them up, which I was willing to do. And they were over a hundred for each. I think because it was a certain kind. My dad ended up not letting me pay for them."
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 5:49 PM",No,"Eh, it's okay. Better than loss of life or limb. And while it's expensive and inconvenient, it's less than having to pay for a new car due to an accident. And less than paying for hospital dues from a potential injury. I'm not upset about it. And hopefully it didn't seem that way on Saturday. \LF\LFThe two tires today come out to $385. So yeah, they're not cheap. Unfortunately. "
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 11:38 PM",Yes,"That's true, hrm. Oh well. I guess things happen."
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 11:39 PM",Yes,I get to watch Jimmy Fallon at work now too! ￼
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:39 PM",No,Haha of course you'd be the one to figure out how to work that feature haha
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:41 PM",No,"Do a search for ""Billy Crystal pays tribute to Robin Williams"" on the Tonight Show. That's the story I was telling you about.  "
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Okay. I'm going back to bed haha
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:41 PM",No,Goodnight Andrew!
+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 11:43 PM",Yes,I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to wake you up!

+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Don't worry about it. No biggie. Night! 
+12103557887,"Oct 6, 2014 11:43 PM",No,Be safe getting home!

+17069923021,"Oct 6, 2014 11:44 PM",Yes,I will
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:08 PM",No,"I hope I didn't make you feel bad last night. I had already been asleep for a couple of hours, and I fell back to sleep really easily. I wanted to respond anyway. If I was too out of it, I would've waited to respond till this morning. "
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:31 PM",No,Hahahahaha hahahaha \LF\LFCheck out this video on YouTube:\LF\LFhttp://youtu.be/uMBXhDcogcI
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 12:32 PM",Yes,"I'm really really sorry. And I felt bad, but not because of anything you said. I am rarely happy when my sleep is interupted, especially when I'm in REM. It makes me feel like my brain has just crashed."
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 12:33 PM",Yes,And did you really send that video link? The formatting of the text looked curiously bot-like.
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:33 PM",No,Don't feel bad! At all! It was a nice way to be woken up haha
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:33 PM",No,"Yes, the video is from me"
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:33 PM",No,I'm pretty sure I wasn't in REM sleep yet haha
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 12:42 PM",Yes,"Ok, I wanted to check before I clicked it lol. Excessive use of whites space is a red flag for me haha.\LF\LFAnd have I really said such vulgarities?"
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:46 PM",No,"Sorry, I added the haha's myself. I thought that would make it clear it wasn't auto-generated hahahaha. Apparently I assumed incorrectly. \LF\LFYou said it a couple times when we were playing Bezzerwizzer haha. I wasn't offended though. Do you really see that as vulgar though?  "
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 12:51 PM",No,"I use ""though"" too much. "
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 12:59 PM",Yes,"I'm sorry. I do find it somewhat inappropriate. If it's not something I feel comfortable saying in front of everyone I know, then I feel I shouldn't be saying it at all. I try to hold myself to a pretty high standard when it comes to bad language because of my past. I used to have a lot of trouble with swearing in middle school. It's taken a lot of work to modify that behavior, and I really don't want to revert back to it. So when I find out I said something without realizing, it worries me a bit.\LF\LFDo you really use ""though"" all that much?"
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:00 PM",Yes,Apart from your last text haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 1:01 PM",No,"Well, I've heard, and said (yikes), much worse. But I can respect that you don't want to be caught saying those words unawares. \LF\LFAnd yes, I think I do say ""though"" quite often. I'm not planning on going back and counting all of the uses within the thread of texts we've got going, although I'm sure it's in there quite a bit. "
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:13 PM",Yes,"Ok so now I'm looking into downloading our text history so that I can parse it for word frequencies. Haha that would be cool.\LF\LFOh, and I didn't bring that up to make you feel weird or judged about your word usage. I have said worse, and do still slip up occasionally with stuff worse than damn."
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:17 PM",Yes,And do you swear like a sailor when I'm not around? Haha.
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 1:17 PM",No,Not typically Hahahaha
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 1:17 PM",No,Around some of my friends who swear a lot I'll slip up though. 
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 1:18 PM",No,It's almost like when I'll accidentally start speaking with an accent that someone I'm talking to has. I just adopt their patterns of speech or language use. But when I'm on my own I don't typically swear at all. 
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 1:19 PM",No,Though occasionally something will make me mad enough to let a slight expletive slip out every now and then. 
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:37 PM",Yes,"Well it sounds like were on a similar level then. I can struggle around Kris some times. He can swear fairly often some days. I hope living with him doesn't affect me in a negative way. Hopefully It'll just end up being easier to avoid mirroring his word choices.\LF\LFSo on the topic of overusing certain words and/or phrases, you might have noticed I end a lot of my sentences with ""or something"". It's a habit I've picked up from my mother haha. The funny thing is, I've started hearing Kris say it! \LF\LFI wonder if he even realized he's doing it. I've always been fascinated in habit mirroring; When you become close to someone you start picking up some of their habits and vocabulary. One thing I realized I picked up from you is that I started texting variations ""haha"" instead of exclusively using ""lol"". Kind of a weird example though lol."
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:42 PM",Yes,Impleggies??? I'm dying. This is great. Mir.I.Am?? Hahaha
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 1:53 PM",Yes,So I've discovered it is possible to download all the texts stored on an iPhone. Now I just have to write some software that will calculate the frequencies! Yay! 
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 2:01 PM",Yes,"My trainee just scared the crap out of me. I'm sitting at one of those ""study desk"" things here at school; headphones in, reviewing Instagram photos. And he comes up behind me and put his hand on my back and says, ""You need to pay more attention."" Haha. Normally I would have been weirded out by that, but we were joking last night about how we both like to sneak up on people. So I guess he drew first blood. I'm going to have to get him back."
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 2:01 PM",No,"Kris swears?! That's surprising! He's generally so quiet and soft-spoken. I guess it's those types that can go either way though. Either they stay soft and quiet at all times, or when they're comfortable they go in a completely different direction. But I'm sure he won't negatively influence you. He has many positive traits that will be good to be around. So overall it'll be a good thing, I think. \LF\LFAnd see, you're already influencing Kris too! Haha\LFYou should start a social experiment and adopt a new word or phrase on purpose and then overuse it only around him to see how long it takes before he picks it up. That might be mean though haha. And you'd have to be entirely sure it was something you'd be okay with getting stuck with yourself. \LF\LFI'll have to start paying attention to the things I say and do with you then to see how I'm mirroring you. I'm sure there's something there. \LF\LFIt's a pretty hilarious video right?!!!!!! I've already watched it like five times Hahahaha genius! I've got a couple other videos I'm going to send you as well. They're not Jimmy Fallon though. But I didn't want to overwhelm you haha. \LF\LFI actually own a program that recovers deleted texts. I've used it once before. When I had to recover some stuff that accidentally got deleted.\LF\LFAre you really going to write a program just for this situation? How do you even start something like that? I'm at a total loss. You really are rather impressive, aren't you? And I'm saying that with no sarcasm or sass or cheek at all. I really mean that.  "
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 2:01 PM",No,Hahaha pranking with someone else now too? 
+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 2:28 PM",Yes,"I don't mean to tattle on him or anything lol, but yes. I was pretty surprised when he started cursing around me.\LF\LFThat's a great idea! I've done stuff similar to that just to see if people will notice, but never in an attempt to make them adopt the behavior. I know I've told you that I want to do some Pavlov conditioning-type experiments with Kris. I just haven't thought of anything to try.\LF\LFYou could send them all to me on FB messenger, that way they don't get lost in chat history.\LF\LFYes I'm really going to write a program for that. Finding frequencies would be really easy. The only part that might be difficult is discerning which texts were from you and which were sent by me. That all depends on how the backup is formatted. Hopefully it's fairly straightforward. This is the type of stuff I love about programming; data processing. Having millions of names for example, then writing a few lines that can capitalize all of those, or count the number of occurrences of ""Jessie""s. "
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 2:50 PM",No,"You're not tattling haha\LFEveryone had their own individual personalities. That's just a part of Kris. No big deal. I've got my own things, as do you. It was just surprising to me is all. \LF\LFI bet if we put our two evil genius brains together I'm sure we could come up with all kinds of silliness to inflict upon poor Kris hahaha\LF\LFI'll try Facebook then. I guess I never really think about other options haha\LF\LFYou're definitely putting your brains and creativity to use. I am genuinely impressed with your abilities. And I can't wait to see what you come up with. And more importantly, how you develop the program.

Except for the blood. I never got that.\LF\LFReally? I guess it's kinda impressive. Would you really be interested in learning how it works?\LF\LFAw man! And Sunday I meant to show you the Tower of Hanoi game I made. Next time you have to remind me lol. I think being in a new environment was a little overwhelming for me at first, so I wasn't necessarily thinking of all the stuff I had planned to show you. And we were going to exchange pictures too.

+17069923021,"Oct 7, 2014 4:41 PM",Yes,"I just found some software that extracts text messages, I just have to update my iPhone back up so that I can get out most recent stuff. Then I'll start trying to figure out how to parse all this stuff."
+12103557887,"Oct 7, 2014 4:41 PM",No,"We are an evil genius pair for sure. But I think what makes it best is that we do it all out of fun and would never use our genius for truly evil purposes. I think it's just that we're both creative and silly and have no problem with letting our inner child out to play. At least, that's my take on it. \LF\LFI'm getting fake blood for the zombie run I'm doing. I'm sure there will be left-overs. We can do it after that! \LF\LFYes, it's very impressive. I'd be totally interested in learning about what you love to do, and more importantly, what you're planning on doing for the rest of your life! I may not fully comprehend all of the ins and outs though, but I'd give it my best to try to get a basic grasp of what you're doing and the process behind it.

I wanted to give you the chance to learn a little more about me. And we totally skipped over a lot of things that day haha. But we'll certainly be able to fix that in the future.
